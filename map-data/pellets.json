    "Name": "The impacts on biodiversity of the wood pellet industry in Southeastern USA",
    "Description": "Forests in the southeastern USA have been actively managed for timber and other wood products for over 200 years. The wood pellet industry  is relatively new and has generated polarised debate between those who want little or no active management of forests in the region, and those who point to the  regionâ€™s long history of sustainable forest management (broadly a debate between conservationists and production forestry proponents). Outside plantations grown for the purpose, the wood pellet industry claims to  use  logging waste and unvalued material from forests harvested for timber. These claims have been contested and assertions made about the damage the industry does to forests in the region. The literature on specific impacts of the wood pallet industry on the ecology of southeastern forests is sparse. In order to determine likely impacts of the industry, an assessment was made of the broader impacts of harvest and extraction techniques which removed residues generally. The impact of such forest  management techniques on terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity has not been systematically assessed, despite a large volume of literature over several decades.. A systematic synthesis of the literature was therefore conducted to create an evidence base of knowledge of relevance to policy and practice in the future. The synthesis followed best practice guidelines on conducting a systematic synthesis. In addition to a searchable database of relevant research, an interactive cartographic map was produced which enables users to interrogate the evidence base according to criteria defined in the format of the evidence data sheets created for each study in the evidence base. Of the 44 studies (20.9%) which reported extractions for fuel uses, or removal of deadwood or slash, only 18 (8.5%) recorded harmful effects on biodiversity. The majority of studies (145) in the evidence base report no negative impacts of forestry practices on biodiversity (68.8%). The review covers, in detail, the subset of papers that do document negative impacts and these can also be filtered and interrogated separately on the systematic map. The analysis shows that within this subset of studies, impacts appear to be greatest for land invertebrates (26.3% of all negative impacts, i.e. 8.2 % of all studies).
