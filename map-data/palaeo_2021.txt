Our results indicate two main periods of environmental change.

At diverse time scales, this process has been clearly associated with climatic and anthropogenic forcings. The question remains, however, how tropical lakes have responded to these two sources of variability. We present a multiproxy record from Lake San Lorenzo, Lagunas de Montebello National Park, tropical Mexico, spanning the last 3400 years. We used multi-elemental concentrations, and Cladocera and pollen assemblages along the record to reconstruct regional and local environmental variability, aiming to infer the factors and processes involved in the evolution of the lacustrine system. A principal component analysis on the pooled biological and geochemical evidence allowed the inference of the main changes in lake level and productivity. At millennial scales, the development of the lake system has been closely associated with regional moisture availability, with wetter (drier) time intervals associated with high (low) lake stands. According to Ti concentrations, from 3400 to 1000 cal. a BP, regional conditions followed a trend towards drier conditions, with littoral cladoceran assemblages suggesting high lake productivity. The extreme regional droughts reportedly associated with the cultural collapse of the Maya civilization manifested in our study area through both high lake productivity and the lowest lake levels of the record. Through the last 800 years, the regional moisture availability has increased, with the water body becoming deeper and larger. Overall, our record offers evidence of a highly variable system strongly coupled with regional climates, but also very sensitive to local disturbances associated with human occupation.

The Cobweb section exposes a complex and dynamically evolving landscape, with a rich interplay between natural and human forces. The Cobweb depression probably formed as a karstic doline or polje in interbedded limestone and marl of late Tertiary or Pleistocene age. During the latest Pleistocene, a terrestrial marsh covered most of the depression. Slope wash and colluviation from adjacent slopes impacted the depression during the early Holocene, possibly in response to a drier and cooler climate reported to have occurred in the region during this time. After ca. 5600 B.P., the Cobweb depression was affected by relatively rapidly rising sea levels in the area, and a brackish lagoon filled the basin. By 4800 B.P., a peat filled in the lagoon, probably because precipitation of a marl in the lagoon coupled with decreasing rates of sea-level rise enabled emergent vegetation to encroach the shallowing waters. Humans first began to affect the landscape when this peat was at the surface. Massive deforestation, resulting in increased runoff and rising water levels, is the most likely explanation for a fresh-water lagoon that again inundated the Cobweb depression between 3400 and 500 B.P. The Maya Clay was deposited on the edge of this lagoon as the result of upland erosion, almost as soon as deforestation began, but the bulk of the deposit was coincident with the sudden collapse of the Classic Maya civilization ca. 1000 B.P., suggesting that significant environmental degradation was associated with the demise of the Classic Maya.

JaeGeun2002_96	2002	"JaeGeun, K.; Rejmankova, E.; Kim, J. G.; Rejmnkov"	"Recent history of sediment deposition in marl- and sand-based marshes of Belize, Central America"	Catena	10.1016/S0341-8162(02)00031-0	"There are two contrasting types of wetlands in Belize: marl- and sand-based marshes. We measured accumulation rates of sediment in six cores from marl- and sand-based marshes of northern Belize and compared biogeochemical characteristics to assess recent wetland history ( ∼ 1850 to present). Sediment depth increments were analysed for bulk density, LOI, nutrients (C, N, P, S, Ca, Mg, K and Na) and snail shell density and species diversity. Cores were dated using 210Pb and a constant rate of supply model. Unsupported 210Pb inventories of the cores ranged from 6.16 to 8.92 pCi cm-2. Marl-based marshes showed the maximum peak of 210Pb activity from 4 to 10 cm below the sediment surface. 210Pb peaks corresponded with the bottom of a marl layer containing chlorophyll a and we suggest that this relationship reflects the high growth and decomposition rates of cyanobacterial mat. Inorganic carbon, Ca, Mg, K, Na, S and Pb contents and accumulation rates were much greater in the marl-based marshes than in the sand-based marshes. Average dry mass accumulation rates in the six marshes ranged from 113 to 572 g m-2 year-1 over the past 100 years. Average linear sedimentation rates during the last 100 years in the two types were not significantly different (0.93 and 1.08 mm year -1, respectively). Increased sediment accumulation by human activities such as soil washout from adjacent roads was recorded in a sand-based marsh near roads. Sediment cores in the marl-based marshes display changes of marsh vegetation, apparently caused by water level changes.

Tree-ring reconstructed dry season rainfall in Guatemala	Climate Dynamics	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2407-y	"Drought in Guatemala has negative consequences for agriculture and potable water supplies, particularly in regions of the country with highly seasonal rainfall. General circulation models suggest that a decrease in both winter and summer rainfall over Central America is likely and imminent as a consequence of anthropogenic influences on the climate system. However, precipitation observations over the last several decades are equivocal. Here, we use an Abies guatemalensis tree-ring chronology from the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes to estimate January through March rainfall since the late seventeenth century. Our reconstruction shows that recent winter-spring rainfall from the region is not yet exceptional in the context of the last several centuries, has a significant yet variable decadal component, is associated with large-scale modes of ocean-atmosphere variability, and reveals evidence of past multiyear droughts."	45	43987	1537-1546	No	Anchukaitis2015_12	English	Guatemala	Sierra de los Cuchumatanes	15.51	-91.6	Dendro	Dendro	Climate;Precipitation	Water	Not Reported	Variance	No							1		Not Reported	1710	2009	Top and Bottom	Not Reported	Not Reported	Not Applicable		Time	No	1378	1378	648	9	42	8430	2720	Central American pine-oak forests	Tropical & Subtropical Coniferous Forests

We find evidence for lower lake level and drier climate at about the same time as each major discontinuity in Maya cultural history: Preclassic Abandonment (150-250 A.D.), Maya Hiatus (534 to 593 A.D.), Terminal Classic Collapse (750-1050 A.D.), and Postclassic Abandonment (mid-fifteenth century). Although these broad temporal correlations suggest climate played a role in Maya cultural evolution, chronological uncertainties preclude a detailed analysis of climate changes and archaeologically documented cultural transformations. \textcopyright 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc."	83	43862	215-240	Yes	Hodell2007_78.viii	English	Mexico	Punta Laguna	20.648487	-87.637178	Lake Sediment Core	δ18O	Climate;Precipitation	Water	"50 ◦C, H2O2, H3PO4"	Not Reported	No		7							"Charcoal, Wood, Seeds"	-1700	2000	Neither	Not Reported	INTCAL04	No		Time	No	1183	1183	505	44	136	5425	22	Yucatán moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

High resolution stalagmite climate record from the YucatÔö£├¡n Peninsula spanning the Maya terminal classic period	Earth and Planetary Science Letters	10.1016/j.epsl.2010.08.016	"The decline of the Classic Maya civilization was complex and geographically variable, and occurred over a \~ 150-year interval, known as the Terminal Classic Period (TCP, C.E. 800-950). Paleoclimate studies based on lake sediments from the Yucat \' a n Peninsula lowlands suggested that drought prevailed during the TCP and was likely an important factor in the disintegration of the Classic Maya civilization. The lacustrine evidence for decades of severe drought in the Yucat \' a n Peninsula, however, does not readily explain the long 150-year socio-political decline of the Classic Maya civilization. Here we present a new, absolute-dated, high-resolution stalagmite $\delta$18O record from the northwest Yucat \' a n Peninsula that provides a much more detailed picture of climate variability during the last 1500years. Direct calibration between stalagmite $\delta$18O and rainfall amount offers the first quantitative estimation of rainfall variability during the Terminal Classic Period. Our results show that eight severe droughts, lasting from 3 to 18years, occurred during major depopulation events of Classic Maya city-states. During these droughts, rainfall was reduced by 52 \% to 36 \% . The number and short duration of the dry intervals help explain why the TCP collapse of the Mayan civilization occurred over 150years. \textcopyright 2010."	298	43862	255-262	No	Medina-Elizalde2010_124	English	Mexico	Tzabnah	20.75	-89.466667	Speleothem	δ18O	Climate;Precipitation	Water	Not Reported	‰	No						12				500	2004	Top and Bottom	Yes	Not Applicable	Not Applicable		Time	Yes	1029	1029	506	23	78	7200	15	Yucatán dry forests	Tropical & Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests

The late Pleistocene was not uniformly cool and was interrupted by brief phases of near present-day warming. The onset of the Holocene was abrupt, taking less than 100 yr, and was almost coincidental with the start of human forest disturbance."	62		251-275	Yes	Bush1992_23.vi	English	Panama	Lago La Yeguada	8.45	-80.85	Lake Sediment Core	Charcoal (Macroscopic)	Fire;Agriculture	Forests;Land Use Change	From Pollen & Phytolith Prep	%	Burning		12							Not Reported	-12350	1950	Top and Bottom	Yes	Not Reported	Not Reported	Logarithmic Time	Time	No	2747	2747	1232	7	94	7025	695	Isthmian-Pacific moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

The entrance of wastewaters is related with an increase in salinity inferred by the diatom record and the organic matter type.

These forests have been transformed by the peoples of the Maya civilization through practices of horticulture, agriculture, and architectural developments over thousands of years. Anthropogenic impacts and the extent of early human interaction with these upland forests is currently poorly understood. In this study we identify: (i) the natural baseline vegetation of the region; (ii) when human impact and agrarian practices began in the Maya uplands; and (iii) what impacts the Maya had on forest structure, composition, and successional regeneration. Past vegetation, anthropogenic use of fire, and faunal abundance were reconstructed using proxy analysis of fossil pollen, macroscopic charcoal, microscopic charcoal, and dung fungal spores (Sporormiella). Three phases of forest succession were identified from 4000B.C.E. to 1522CE that broadly overlap with the well-defined archaeological periods of (i) the Archaic (10,000-2000B.C.E.); (ii) Pre-Classic (2000B.C.E.-100C.E.); (iii) Terminal Pre-Classic (100-250C.E.); (iv) Classic (250-950C.E.); and (v) Post-Classic (950-1522C.E.). These results also include the earliest evidence for agriculture within the Southern Maya Area through presence of peppers (Capsicum) from 3850B.C.E. and the rise of maize cultivation (Zea mays) from 970B.C.E. Persistent high intensity burning driven by agricultural practices and lime production during the Late-Pre-Classic (400-100B.C.E.) to Classic Period resulted in a compositional change of forest structure c.150B.C.E. from oak (Quercus) dominated forests to pine (Pinus) dominated forests.

El Palmar's 3 m stratigraphic record began in the Archaic period before 1500 B.C. at or just before initial Maya impacts. From the lowest level, Late Archaic organic deposition, with evidence for diverse tropical forest and a steady water table, transitioned to Early Preclassic clay deposition, decreased forest taxa, three known food taxa, and more economic species. Clay deposition continued through the Preclassic, with occasional organic and high charcoal deposition, increasing maize, and other possible economic pollen. Classic El Palmar saw a new land use type with continued disturbance evidence but diverse and greater forest cover. Human impacts continued, leaving high amounts of disturbance taxa, charcoal, and the highest maize pollen level, concomitant with lower deposition rates, $\delta$13C evidence of increased, diverse tropical forest taxa and organic sediments. El Zotz Aguada's Early Classic to Postclassic sediment record overlaps this, with maize and squash pollen evidence changing to Classic period copal tree pollen dominance.

"Holocene climatic and human influences on lakes of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico: an interdisciplinary, palaeolimnological approach"			"The effects of Holocene climate change and human influence on 3 lakes of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, (representing a gradient of increasing modern precipitation and density of former Maya settlement) were studied. At Lake Coba, an 880 cm sediment core yielded a complete record of lacustrine sedimentation that began when the lake first filled \~ 8000 BP as groundwater level rose. Lake Coba was initially shallow and saline. Coba (highest precipitation) showed more episodic water-level changes than Lake San Jose Chulchaca or Lake Sayaucil. High lake level and fresh water were evident at 440 cm ( \~ 2600 BP), followed by a decline in water levels and an increase in total ionic salinity to the present time. In a 613 cm core from Sayaucil (intermediate precipitation) total salinity was high between 600 and 400 cm ( \~ 3050 and 2000 BP), followed by higher water levels. Salinity was high in the lower portion of a 110 cm San Jose Chulchaca core (beginning \~ 1860 BP), followed by freshening of water to the present time. Maximal human disturbance at Lake Coba occurred during a deep-water event at 440 cm, followed by a decline in human influence and trophic state to the present time. Trophic state and linear sedimentation rates in Sayaucil increased above 400 cm (after \~ 2000 BP). Limnological disturbance may have preceded the period of maximal human occupation because initial land clearance and consequent soil erosion probably affected water quality substantially. San Jose Chulchaca lacks archaeological evidence of human occupation in the drainage, and shows gradual changes in trophic state. Some 14C dates and chronologies may be artificially old as a consequence of hard-water-lake error. Trophic state changes in the lakes were consistent with patterns of human settlement and population change. Late-Holocene water-level fluctuations were most pronounced in Lake Coba in eastern Yucatan where lake level is lower than during much of the past. Lake level was constant in Sayaucil in the central peninsula, whereas lake level increased gradually over time in San Jose Chulchaca in the arid western portion of the peninsula."	5		273-287	Yes	Whitmore1996_196.ii	English	Mexico	Coba	20.491511	-87.738733	Lake Sediment Core	δ13C	Productivity	None	UIC/Coulometrics Model 5011 coulometer	SMOW ‰	No									Mud	-5650	1950	Bottom	Not Reported	Not Reported	Not Reported		Depth	No	1151	1151	500	42	129	5567	14	Yucatán moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Pre-aged plant waxes in tropical lake sediments and their influence on the chronology of molecular paleoclimate proxy records	Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2014.06.030	"Sedimentary records of plant-wax hydrogen ( delta Dwax) and carbon ( delta 13Cwax) stable isotopes are increasingly applied to infer past climate change. Compound-specific radiocarbon analyses, however, indicate that long time lags can occur between the synthesis of plant waxes and their subsequent deposition in marginal marine sediments. The influence of these time lags on interpretations of plant-wax stable isotope records is presently unconstrained, and it is unclear whether such time lags also affect lacustrine sediments. We present compound-specific radiocarbon (14Cwax) data for n-alkanoic acid plant waxes (n-C26 to n-C32) from: (1) a sediment core from Lake Chichancanab, Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, (2) soils in the Lake Chichancanab catchment, and (3) surface sediments from three other lakes in southeastern Mexico and northern Guatemala. 14Cwax ages in the surface sediments are consistently older than modern, and may be negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation and positively correlated with lake catchment area. 14Cwax ages in soils surrounding Lake Chichancanab increase with soil depth, consistent with deep, subsoil horizons being the primary source of lacustrine aged plant waxes, which are likely delivered to lake sediments through subsurface transport. Plant waxes in the Lake Chichancanab core are 350-1200 years older than corresponding ages of bulk sediment deposition, determined by 14C dates on terrestrial plant macrofossils in the core. A delta Dwax time series is in closer agreement with other regional proxy hydroclimate records when a plant-wax 14C age model is applied, as opposed to the macrofossil-based core chronology. Inverse modeling of plant-wax age distribution parameters suggests that plant waxes in the Lake Chichancanab sediment core derive predominantly from millennial-age soil carbon pools that exhibit relatively little age variance ( \textless 200 years). Our findings demonstrate that high-temporal-resolution climate records inferred from stable isotope measures on plant waxes in lacustrine sediments may suffer from possible chronologic distortions as a consequence of long residence times of plant waxes in soils. They also underscore the importance of direct radiocarbon dating of these organic molecules."	141		346-364	Yes	Douglas2014_44.i	English	Mexico	Lago Chichancanab	19.87	-88.77	Lake Sediment Core	δ13C	Aquatic Vegetation	Water	1 M KOH	SMOW ‰	No		9							Leaf waxes	N/A	N/A	Bottom	Not Reported	INTCAL13	Yes	Age reversals recorded	Time	Yes	1244	1244	548	31	105	6267	36	Yucatán moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Our findings demonstrate that high-temporal-resolution climate records inferred from stable isotope measures on plant waxes in lacustrine sediments may suffer from possible chronologic distortions as a consequence of long residence times of plant waxes in soils. They also underscore the importance of direct radiocarbon dating of these organic molecules."	141		346-364	Yes	Douglas2014_44.ii	English	Mexico	Lago Chichancanab	19.87	-88.77	Lake Sediment Core	dDwax	Climate;Precipitation	Water	1 M KOH	SMOW ‰	No		9							Leaf waxes	N/A	N/A	Bottom	Not Reported	INTCAL13	Yes	Age reversals recorded	Time	Yes	1244	1244	548	31	105	6267	36	Yucatán moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

The main motivation of this study was to determine the implications of drip water hydrology for the reconstruction of rainfall, droughts and tropical cyclone activity from stalagmite δ18O records. Monitoring of environmental and isotopic conditions was conducted for two years, from June 2017 to April 2019. This study provides the first instrumental evidence of an “amount effect” on interannual timescales in the Yucatán Peninsula. Observed bi-weekly to interannual variability in drip water δ18O values can be explained for individual drips by different integrations of rainfall amount in the time domain. Drip sites in two chambers (Stations A and B) integrate 4–15 months of rainfall accumulation. In a third chamber (Station LF) one drip site reflects the annual rainfall isotopic cycle with a positive offset and another, the largest rainfall events. During epikarst infiltration, the integration of rainfall amount by drip water source reservoirs determines the degree to which they “dilute” a tropical cyclone (TC) isotopic signature. TCs can be detected particularly when: (1) the water volume of the reservoir is low, such as during a persistent meteorological drought, and; (2) TCs have a sufficiently distinct isotopic signal relative to that of the reservoir prior to the event. TC isotopic signals can be masked or attenuated when drip water samples integrate more than a week and if significant rainfall events proceed the TC. In Río Secreto cave, reconstructing precipitation amount and detecting the TC isotopic signatures from stalagmite δ18O records is possible. Our analysis shows that stalagmite δ18O records are more likely to underestimate the magnitude of annual-scale droughts following normal hydroclimate conditions and more likely to record TCs during multiyear droughts than during normal or wet periods. Drip water monitoring results suggest that available stalagmite δ18O records from the Maya lowlands might be underestimating the intensity of paleo-drought events, such as the Terminal Classic droughts associated with the disintegration of the Maya civilization. This study complements the results from Lases-Hernandez et al. (2019) comparing two different sampling protocols of drip water collection. This study shows that a discrete sampling protocol is expected to approximate the amount-weighted isotopic composition of a drip, as long as it is conducted at a temporal resolution higher than the rainfall integration time by the drip reservoir. We highlight the importance of conducting multiyear monitoring of drip water and rainfall in order to interpret stalagmite δ18O as a paleoclimate proxy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"	285		237-256	No	Lases-Hernandez2020_208	English	Mexico	Rio Secreto Cave	20.35244	-87.8042	Speleothem	δ18O	Climate;Precipitation	Water	HNO3 Rinse & Dry	VSMOW ‰	No										2014	2019	Top and Bottom	Yes	Not Applicable	Not Reported	Absolute Measurement	Time	Yes	1155	1155	497	41	128	5543	16	Yucatán moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Lacustrine stable isotope record of precipitation changes in Nicaragua during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly	Geology	10.1130/G33736.1	"Discerning the influences of the El Ni \~ n o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on drought variability in the tropics during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA) will help to improve our understanding of climate system responses to internal and external forcing. Sediments from Lago El Gancho, Nicaragua, provide an \~ 1400 yr record of water balance (precipitation and evaporation) changes from a region that is sensitive to teleconnected Pacific and Atlantic ocean-atmosphere dynamics. Oxygen isotope values of ostracod carapaces ($\delta$18Oostracod) are consistently low in El Gancho sediments between ca. A.D. 950 and 1250, indicating that wetter conditions prevailed during the MCA, a period of La Ni \~ n a-like mean state conditions in the tropical Pacific, and a positive mean state of the NAO. The \~ 150 yr period between the MCA and LIA was marked by an abrupt shift to persistently drier conditions at a time of highly variable Pacific sea-surface temperatures, and a transition toward a more negative NAO phase. In sediment from ca. A.D. 1450 to the present, $\delta$18Oostracod values increase, suggesting that drier conditions persisted through most of the LIA, a time of a relatively negative NAO phase and El Ni \~ n o-like mean state conditions in the tropical Pacific. The long-term precipitation trends inferred from the El Gancho data are not entirely consistent with modern associations between precipitation in the circum-Caribbean region and the NAO, suggesting that present-day hydroclimatic shifts resulting from variability in synoptic climate patterns are dissimilar to changes resulting from teleconnected ocean-atmosphere dynamics that operated during the MCA and LIA. \textcopyright 2012 Geological Society of America."	41	2	151-154	No	Stansell2013_175	English	Nicaragua	El Gancho	11.906	-85.918	Lake Sediment Core	δ18O	Climate;Precipitation	Water	Not Reported	VPDB ‰	No		5							Charcoal	600	2004	Bottom	Yes	INTCAL09	Not Reported		Time	No	1535	1535	863	2	16	9899	43	Central American dry forests	Tropical & Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests

"Wetland geomorphology and paleoecology near Akab Muclil, Rio Bravo floodplain of the Belize coastal plain"	Geomorphology	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.10.015	"To understand wetland geomorphology and paleoecology, we collected a 2.6 m sediment core from a flooded swamp adjacent to the Maya archaeological site of Akab Muclil in the Maya Lowlands of northwestern Belize. The site of Akab Muclil has a known occupation that persisted from Early Maya Classic (1700-1350 BP) through the Terminal Maya Classic (1180-1050 BP) and into the Postclassic (1050-450 BP) and lies near a vast network of ancient Maya canal and field systems. We analyzed this core using a combination of paleoecological and geochemical techniques to determine the history of land use and natural change over time within this wetland. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry dating, pollen, charcoal analysis, micropaleontology, geochemical analysis, and magnetic susceptibility provide a suite of methods from which we interpret the geomorphic and ecological history of this wetland system. Four AMS dates from the length of the core provide us with an age model that runs from 1675 cal BP through the Maya Classic onward to the present. At the base of this system, soil composition and chemistry provide evidence that the system changed from a seasonally wet terrestrial soil to a perennially wet swamp, as the basal Mollisol soil lies buried by peats and calcareous sediments. This shift to a perennial wetland could be related to ancient Maya water management or a natural geomorphic change, though we suspect the former because of nearby ancient Maya large-scale geomorphic and hydrological manipulation in the form of intensive canalization and agriculture. Evidence of ancient Maya uses and impacts, including sedimentation, Zea mays pollen, and high charcoal counts occur from the lowest levels of the sequence through the Classic and into the Postclassic period. Above this level, the strata change to stable peats, laminated deposits of light gray/dark gray gypsum, authigenic carbonate, and layers of fibrist peat, with little evidence of human impact until recent increases in charcoal and phosphorous. This study, compared with other regional studies, indicates a later transition from terrestrial to wetland, later human impacts in the Postclassic, and a geomorphic impact record closely tied to the history of the adjacent site rather than broader land use trends."	331		146-159	Yes	Krause2019_108.v	English	Belize	Akab Muclil	17.824612	-88.889705	Swamp Sediments	Geochemistry	Catchment Erosion;Land Use Change	Forests;Land Use Change	Olympus BTX profile XRF on Helium mode	%	Catchment Erosion		4							Not Reported	225	2014	Top and Bottom	Not Reported	Not Reported	Not Reported		Depth	No	1512	1512	605	38	124	5497	46	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

This new conservative proxy for paleotempestology recorded cave flooding events with a recurrence interval of 8.3 years during the twentieth century, with the greatest frequency during the twentieth century and the least frequent during the seventeenth century. Tropical cyclone (TC) events are unlikely to flood the cave during drought when the water table is depressed. Applying TC masking to the Chaac paleorainfall reconstruction suggests that the severity of the Maya megadroughts was underestimated. Without a high-resolution radiometric geochronology of individual local TC events, speleothem isotope records cannot resolve whether the Terminal Classic Period in the northern Maya Lowlands was punctuated by several brief drought breaks with normal TCs, or whether the region was very dry and peppered by unusually severe and frequent hurricane seasons. \textcopyright 2014.

High-resolution speleothem record of precipitation from the Yucatan Peninsula spanning the Maya Preclassic Period	Global and Planetary Change	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.10.003	"We produced a new high-resolution absolute U-Th dated stalagmite oxygen isotope record ($\delta$18O) from R \' i o Secreto, Playa del Carmen, Yucatan Peninsula (YP). This new 1434-year stalagmite record (named Itzamna after the Maya god of creation) spans the time interval between BCE 1037 and CE 397 with an average resolution of 8 ± 2 years. It provides a novel view of climate evolution over the Preclassic and early Classic periods in Maya history. To understand the controls of regional precipitation $\delta$18O on seasonal time scales, we characterized the amount effect between precipitation amount (P) and precipitation $\delta$18O ($\delta$P). We found that precipitation $\delta$18O in the Yucatan Peninsula is controlled by the amount effect on seasonal scales ($\delta$P/$\delta$P = -0.0137 ± 0.0031‰ per mm, r = 0.9), as suspected but never before demonstrated. Cave drip $\delta$18O is consistent with the annual amount-weighted $\delta$18O composition of precipitation. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that stalagmite $\delta$18O reflects isotopic equilibrium conditions and thus stalagmite $\delta$18O changes are interpreted to reflect precipitation amount. We determined quantitative precipitation changes from the stalagmite $\delta$18O record following previous methods (Medina-Elizalde and Rohling, 2012). The stalagmite precipitation record suggests twelve periods of anomalous precipitation reductions ranging between about 30 and 70 \% below mean conditions at the time and with durations from 6 years to 31 years. Between BCE 520 and 166, the speleothem precipitation record suggests that the YP experienced an interval of high precipitation labeled the Late Preclassic Humid Period (LPHP) with precipitation maxima of up to +86 ± 20 \% . Preclassic Maya cultural expansion in El Mirador Basin, located in northern Guatemala, took place while the peninsula transitioned from the LPHP to an interval with below average precipitation. We find that the Preclassic abandonment of major centers in the Mirador Basin and others around the Maya Lowlands was synchronous with two unprecedented multi-decadal events of severe precipitation reduction with magnitudes of -55 ± 13 \% and -49 ± 12 and centered at CE 186 and 234, respectively. We also find evidence that centennial scale precipitation variability in the YP during the Preclassic Period may have been associated with shifts in rainfall fluxes from Atlantic tropical cyclones. \textcopyright 2015 Elsevier B.V."	138		93-102	No	Medina-Elizalde2016_125	English	Mexico	Laberinto del Fauno	20.5874	-87.134033	Speleothem	δ18O	Climate;Precipitation	Water	On-line carbonate preparation system linked to a Finnigan Delta Plus XL ratio mass spectrometer.

The following 3600 years are marked by significant opening of the forest and episodic pulses of erosion. During the early Preclassic, around 1450 BC, all proxies indicate an abrupt increase in human activity, coincident with archaeological evidence of early settlement. Three discrete periods of decreased human activity are indicated by cessations of landscape disturbance. Such decreased human activity likely reflects periodic local population decline. These events coincide with times of cultural transition in the Maya lowlands and correspond to the terminal phases of the middle Preclassic, late Preclassic and late Classic periods.

"Holocene environmental history of tropical, mid-altitude Lake Ocotalito, México, inferred from ostracodes and non-biological indicators"	Holocene	10.1177/0959683616687384	"This paleolimnological study used ostracodes assemblages, element concentrations, organic and inorganic carbon content, organic C:N ratios, and stable isotope values in valves of the ostracodes Cytheridella ilosvayi as paleoindicators and is the first such investigation from a mid-elevation site in southern México. We provide a ~7600-year (9540–1970 BP) environmental history from karst Lake Ocotalito (920 m a.s.l.), which lies in the Lacandon Forest of Chiapas, México. A 5.4-m sediment core was retrieved from a water depth of 23 m. The main factor that shaped ostracodes species assemblages throughout the Holocene was lake level. A total of six species were identified, and the benthic Cytheridella ilosvayi was dominant. Less abundant species included nektobenthic taxa Cypridopsis okeechobei, Heterocypris putei, and Potamocypris sp. and benthic species Darwinula stevensoni and Pseudocandona sp. Wet conditions, high lake levels (&gt;15 m), and low ostracodes abundances characterized the period between ~9540 and ~7820 BP. From ~7750 to 6460 BP, indicators point to stable conditions and intermediate lake levels (~15 m). Greatest ostracodes abundance and diversity occurred from ~6200 to ~4030 BP, during which mainly drier conditions were inferred, interrupted by short, humid periods. Lower abundances and low Sr and δ18O values characterized the period from ~3810 to ~1970 BP and indicate higher lake levels, that is, wetter conditions. Throughout this period, however, a slight trend toward drier conditions was observed. Comparison with paleolimnological studies in other karst lakes from the region suggests mid-altitude aquatic ecosystems may be more sensitive to climate fluctuations than lakes in the lowlands. For instance, stable isotope records from the Lake Ocotalito core display greater ranges. This, however, may simply reflect inter-lake differences in sensitivity, controlled by lake-specific hydrologic factors. The record from Lake Ocotalito fills an important gap in our knowledge of past biotic diversity, paleoclimate, and paleoenvironmental conditions in the northern Neotropics. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."	27	9	1308-1317	No	Díaz2017_40	English	Mexico	Lake Ocotalito	16.9	-91.6	Lake Sediment Core	Ostracodea	Climate;Precipitation;Water Level	Water	H2O2	No. of	No		7							Not Reported	-7590	1950	Bottom	Not Reported	INTCAL13	Not Reported		Time	No	2025	2025	887	52	167	6573	687	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

JaeGeun2002_96	2002	"JaeGeun, K.; Rejmankova, E.; Kim, J. G.; Rejmnkov"	"Recent history of sediment deposition in marl- and sand-based marshes of Belize, Central America"	Catena	10.1016/S0341-8162(02)00031-0	"There are two contrasting types of wetlands in Belize: marl- and sand-based marshes. We measured accumulation rates of sediment in six cores from marl- and sand-based marshes of northern Belize and compared biogeochemical characteristics to assess recent wetland history ( ∼ 1850 to present). Sediment depth increments were analysed for bulk density, LOI, nutrients (C, N, P, S, Ca, Mg, K and Na) and snail shell density and species diversity. Cores were dated using 210Pb and a constant rate of supply model. Unsupported 210Pb inventories of the cores ranged from 6.16 to 8.92 pCi cm-2. Marl-based marshes showed the maximum peak of 210Pb activity from 4 to 10 cm below the sediment surface. 210Pb peaks corresponded with the bottom of a marl layer containing chlorophyll a and we suggest that this relationship reflects the high growth and decomposition rates of cyanobacterial mat. Inorganic carbon, Ca, Mg, K, Na, S and Pb contents and accumulation rates were much greater in the marl-based marshes than in the sand-based marshes. Average dry mass accumulation rates in the six marshes ranged from 113 to 572 g m-2 year-1 over the past 100 years. Average linear sedimentation rates during the last 100 years in the two types were not significantly different (0.93 and 1.08 mm year -1, respectively).

The role of people in the creation and maintenance of Central American savannas is considered in light of the paleoecological record. The data suggest that pre-Columbian inhabitants of western El Salvador suppressed shrub and tree encroachment via frequent burning from ca. 2500 to 500 cal yr. B.P. A substantial increase in woody taxa (Mimosoideae, Urticales) and a decrease in biomass burning are evident in the pollen and charcoal records beginning around the time of the first European contact (ca 500 cal yr B.P.). Evidence for frequent burning and grassland dominance before the arrival of the Europeans, followed by shrub and tree encroachment amid a near absence of fire after contact, suggests that the openness of the Ahuachapan savanna was maintained by the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Rio Paz Valley throughout the late Holocene."	32	3	219-231	Yes	Dull2004_46.iv	English	El Salvador	Laguna del Espino	13.57	-89.52	Lake Sediment Core	Magnetic Susceptibility	Catchment Erosion	None	Bartington MS2C	k	No		3						1	Bulk lake sediments/paleosol	-6570	1950	Bottom	No	INTCAL98	No		Depth	No	1850	1850	995	2	16	9579	413	Central American dry forests	Tropical & Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests

"Ancient maya wetland agricultural fields in cobweb swamp, belize: Construction, chronology, and function"	Journal of Field Archaeology	10.1179/009346995791547877	"A series of channel/island features at the archaeological site of Colha on the margins of Cobweb Swamp in northern Belize were determined to be relics of ancient wetland agricultural fields. Conformation of the stratigraphy in both mounded and nonmounded areas, as examined in pits and trenches, revealed definite human modification of the buried Cobweb Paleosol. Radiocarbon assays of sediment and charcoal suggest the Maya dug ditches in the Cobweb surface by at least a.c. 600 and possibly much earlier, in the Late Preclassic or Middle Preclassic, probably in an attempt to manage water levels and enable crop production on the fertile swamp-margin soils. The wetland fields were buried by the Maya Clay, apparently the result of erosion of the adjacent upland soils. The Maya Clay probably began to accumulate on the swamp margin as soon as the Maya began cropping the adjacent uplands, but the bulk of it was deposited after about a.c. 850. The Maya may have continued to crop the fertile wetland fields even after massive deposition of the Maya Clay. \textcopyright 1995 Maney Publishing."	22	2	175-190	No	Jacob1995_94	English	Belize	Cobweb Swamp	17.937719	-88.366374	Swamp Sediment Core	Stratagraphic Description	Land Use Change	Forests;Land Use Change	Stratigraphic description	Units	No	1	6							"Sediment, Charcoal, Wood, Bulk Soil Carbon"	Not Reported	Not Reported	Neither	Not Reported	Stuiver and Reimer 1987	Not Reported		Depth	Yes	1641	1641	627	42	136	5337	15	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

High-resolution monsoon records are sparse, despite the role of ENSO in generating global hydrologic anomalies in modern climate. To investigate the relationship between ENSO and the Central American Monsoon, we generated a high-resolution ( similar to 2.9 years/sample) oxygen-isotope monsoon rainfall record from a U/Th-dated stalagmite ( 180 B. C. to 1310 A. D.) from the Isthmus of Panama. We present evidence for a weakened monsoon during the ``High Medieval'' ( 1100 - 1200 A. D.) and the Classic Maya Collapse ( 750 - 950 A. D.). Rainfall decreased and was more variable after 550 A. D., and the period 900 - 1310 A. D. was drier than the preceding millennium. A weaker monsoon corresponds with increased El Nino variability, and our data display statistical variance in the ENSO band. We conclude that ENSO variation has forced isthmian rainfall and may have contributed to hemispheric climatic anomalies at this time."	109	20	D20117 1-8	Yes	Lachniet2004_112.i	English	Panama	Chilibrillo Cave	9.2	-79.7	Speleothem	δ18O	Climate;Precipitation	Water	Anhydrous phosphoric acid at 70C	VPDB ‰	No						5				-180	1320	Top and Bottom	Yes	Not Reported	Not Applicable		Time	No	2748	2748	1040	18	103	6282	136	Isthmian-Atlantic moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

High-resolution monsoon records are sparse, despite the role of ENSO in generating global hydrologic anomalies in modern climate. To investigate the relationship between ENSO and the Central American Monsoon, we generated a high-resolution ( similar to 2.9 years/sample) oxygen-isotope monsoon rainfall record from a U/Th-dated stalagmite ( 180 B. C. to 1310 A. D.) from the Isthmus of Panama. We present evidence for a weakened monsoon during the ``High Medieval'' ( 1100 - 1200 A. D.) and the Classic Maya Collapse ( 750 - 950 A. D.). Rainfall decreased and was more variable after 550 A. D., and the period 900 - 1310 A. D. was drier than the preceding millennium. A weaker monsoon corresponds with increased El Nino variability, and our data display statistical variance in the ENSO band. We conclude that ENSO variation has forced isthmian rainfall and may have contributed to hemispheric climatic anomalies at this time."	109	20	D20117 1-8	Yes	Lachniet2004_112.ii	English	Panama	Chilibrillo Cave	9.2	-79.7	Speleothem	δ13C	Climate;Precipitation	Water	Anhydrous phosphoric acid at 70C	VPDB ‰	No						5				-180	1320	Top and Bottom	Yes	Not Reported	Not Applicable		Time	No	2748	2748	1040	18	103	6282	136	Isthmian-Atlantic moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Stable isotope chronology and climate signal calibration in neotropical montane cloud forest trees	Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences	10.1029/2007JG000613	"Tropical montane cloud forests are ecosystems intrinsically linked to a narrow range of geographic and meteorological conditions, making them potentially sensitive to small changes in precipitation or temperature. We investigate the potential application of stable isotope analysis to cloud forest dendroclimatology at Monteverde in Costa Rica in order to be able to extract both chronological and paleoclimate information from trees without annual growth rings. High-resolution $\delta$18O measurements are used to identify regular cycles in wood of up to 9 \% , which are associated with seasonal changes in precipitation and moisture sources. The calculated annual growth rates derived from the isotope time series match those observed from long-term basal growth measurements. Interannual variability in the oxygen isotope ratio of lower forest trees is primarily related to interannual changes in wet season precipitation. Forward modeling independently supports our detection of both annual chronology and a climate signal. The confirmation of annual chronology and sensitivity to interannual climate anomalies suggests that tropical cloud forest dendroclimatology can be used to investigate local and regional hydroclimatic variability and change.

"A multi-proxy study of Holocene environmental change in the Maya Lowlands of Peten, Guatemala"	Journal of Paleolimnology	10.1023/A:1007968508262	"We used multiple variables in a sediment core from Lake Peten-Itza, Peten, Guatemala, to infer Holocene climate change and human influence on the regional environment. Multiple proxies including pollen, stable isotope geochemistry, elemental composition, and magnetic susceptibility in samples from the same core allow differentiation of natural versus anthropogenic environmental changes. Core chronology is based on AMS 14C measurement of terrestrial wood and charcoal and thus avoids the vagaries of hard-water-lake error. During the earliest Holocene, prior to \~ 9000 14C yr BP, the coting site was not covered by water and all proxies suggest that climatic conditions were relatively dry. Water covered the coring site by \~ 9000 14C yr BP, coinciding with filling of other lakes in Peten and farther north on the Yucatan Peninsula. During the early Holocene ( \~ 9000 to \~ 6800 14C yr BP), pollen data suggest moist conditions, but high $\delta$18O values are indicative of relatively high E/P. This apparent discrepancy may be due to a greater fractional loss of the lake's water budget to evaporation during the early stages of lake filling. Nonetheless, conditions were moist enough to support semi-deciduous lowland forest. Decrease in $\delta$18O values and associated change in ostracod species at \~ 6800 14C yr BP suggest a transition to even moister conditions.

Diatoms are common in the profile, which we subdivide into three zones. Zone C (∼3240-1020 cal yr B.P.) is dominated by Staurosira construens var. venter and Aulacoseira spp.; during this time, the lake was dilute and circumneutral. Benthic and acidophilous taxa increase gradually in the upper section of this zone. Zone B (∼1020-460 cal yr B.P.) almost totally lacks Aulacoseira, and instead is dominated by combinations of Eunotia minor, Encyonema lunatum, Gomphonema gracile, and Pinnularia braunii. Previous pollen and charcoal analysis indicates that this zone falls within the peak of prehistoric agricultural activity at the lake, but diatoms may also reflect climate change. During this period, the lake was likely shallower and more acidic, but not eutrophic. Finally, Zone A (∼460 cal yr B.P. to AD 1997) begins near a 1.5-cm tephra layer from nearby Volc \' a n Bar \' u ; diatom assemblages are dominated by Aulacoseira spp., and suggest deepening of the lake and return to conditions similar to Zone C. This was a time of indigenous population decline and forest recovery in the Zoncho region, probably reflecting the impact of European diseases on the native population, although climate change and impacts of the tephra deposition cannot be wholly discounted. \textcopyright Springer 2005."	33	3	361-369	No	Haberyan2005_69	English	Costa Rica	Laguna Zoncho	8.813056	-82.963056	Lake Sediment Core	Diatoms	Climate;Precipitation;Water Level	Water	"Nitric acid, Naphrax mount"	%	Increase in Eutrophic Conditions		3							"Charcoal, seeds and leaf fragments"	-1290	1950	Bottom	Not Reported	INTCAL98	Not Reported		Depth	No	2841	2841	1165	40	166	6482	1094	Talamancan montane forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Wahl2006_190	2006	"Wahl, D.; Byrne, R.; Schreiner, T.; Hansen, R."	Holocene vegetation change in the northern Peten and its implications for Maya prehistory			"An \~ 8400 cal yr record of vegetation change from the northern Peten, Guatemala, provides new insights into the environmental history of the archaeological area known as the Mirador Basin. Pollen, loss on ignition, and magnetic susceptibility analyses indicate warm and humid conditions in the early to mid-Holocene. Evidence for a decrease in forest cover around 4600 cal yr B.P. coincides with the first appearance of Zea mays pollen, suggesting that human activity was responsible.

Sedimentary stable carbon isotope evidence of late Quaternary vegetation and climate change in highland Costa Rica	Journal of Paleolimnology	10.1007/s10933-011-9500-6	"Continuous terrestrial records of paleoclimate and paleovegetation that extend to the late Pleistocene are rare for the circum-Caribbean uplands. In this study we analyzed the bulk and compound-specific carbon isotope composition of lake sediments spanning this period from Lago de las Morrenas 1 (LM1), a glacial lake in the highlands of southern Costa Rica, for evidence of climate and vegetation changes that may not have been apparent in previous analyses. The stable carbon isotope ratios of n-alkanes typically derived from terrestrial plants ($\delta$13CC27-C33) indicate an increased abundance of C4 plant taxa during the late Pleistocene and earliest Holocene that may be related to decreased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, increased aridity, or habitat availability. These n-alkane isotope ratios also provide evidence of more arid conditions during the early and late Holocene, and more mesic conditions during the middle Holocene, a pattern prevalent in other paleoclimate records from the region that is thought to be related to millennial-scale dynamics of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The sensitivity of the LM1 paleorecord to trade wind dynamics provides further support for the role of millennial-scale shifts in ITCZ dynamics in driving neotropical environmental change, and indicates that the effects of ITCZ migration were not limited to the lowlands. \textcopyright 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."	45	3	323-338	No	Lane2011_114	English	Costa Rica	Lago de las Morrenas	9.494444	-83.487222	Lake Sediment Core	δ13C	Vegetation	Water	HCL	VPDB %	No		6							Not Reported	-9050	1989	Top and Bottom	Yes	INTCAL04	Not Reported		Time	No	2202	2202	957	11	65	7181	3509	Talamancan montane forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Above a horizon of coarser grains deposited sometime between \~ 5,200 and 1,600 cal yr BP, planktonic diatoms increased and remained dominant to the top of the core, indicating that water depth permanently increased. Although magnetic susceptibility peaked and water content dipped at the coarse horizon, volcanic glass fragments did not increase, suggesting that the coarse horizon and subsequent increase in water depth were caused by tectonic rather than by volcanic activity.

It is near the northern limit of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which brings the rainy season to the tropics, so effects of decreasing precipitation due to southern migration of the ITCZ through the Holocene should be observable. Because fault zones and an active volcano lie within the lake, the long-term impact of tectonic and volcanic activity can also be examined.

Assessing intra-basin spatial variability in geochemical and isotopic signatures in the sediments of a small neotropical lake	Journal of Paleolimnology	10.1007/s10933-015-9859-x	"We examined intra-basin spatial variability of sedimentary geochemical and isotopic signals using a network of five sediment cores from a small lake in southern Costa Rica with a history of prehistoric maize agriculture in its watershed. All cores show a similar pattern of agricultural activity (2000–1000 cal yr BP), a transitional period of forest recovery (1000–675 cal yr BP), and a period after forest reestablishment (675–400 cal yr BP). During the agricultural period, bulk sediment stable carbon isotope ratios ($\delta$13CTOC) indicate significant forest clearance, percent total organic carbon ( \% TOC) is low due to accelerated erosion and dilution from mineral inputs to the lake, and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios are consistent with increased productivity. At the conclusion of the agricultural period, $\delta$13CTOC and \% TOC indicate rapid forest recovery and reduced mineral inputs and C/N ratios suggest lower lake productivity. There is little between-core variation in the magnitude of the agricultural signal for the four cores taken near the shore, but these cores indicate different timing for the end of widespread agriculture in the watershed. Three of these four cores indicate nearly all agriculture ended by 1000 cal yr BP, but in the fourth core agricultural indicators persist until 675 cal yr BP. The core from the center of the lake shows a gradual decline in proxies indicating agriculture from 950 to 650 cal yr BP, which suggests sediment-reworking processes are integrating material from the entire basin as it is transported to the deeper portions of the lake. Differences between the records from the cores recovered near the shore illustrate the potential of multiple core studies to create spatially explicit paleoenvironmental reconstructions, while the delayed and less abrupt changes in the core from the center of the lake highlight the importance of sediment reworking of paleoenvironmental indicators. \textcopyright 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."	54	4	395-411	Yes	Taylor2015_179.i	English	Costa Rica	Laguna Zoncho	8.812	-82.961	Lake Sediment Core	Inorganic Carbon	Catchment Erosion;Agriculture	Land Use Change	"Costech Elemental Analyzer (EA) coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan XL+ Mass Spectrometer., LOI"	%	Catchment Erosion		3							Bulk sediment and plant material	0	1950	Bottom	Not Reported	INTCAL04	Not Reported		Time	No	2841	2841	1165	40	166	6482	1094	Talamancan montane forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

A Paleoecological record from a Late Classic Maya reservoir in the north Peten	Latin American Antiquity	10.2307/25063105	"Aguada Zacatal is a reservoir located within a bajo 4 kin west of Nakbe, Peten, Guatemala. It is 100 in in diameter and the surrounding berm is approximately I in tall. The small Classic period site of Zacatal is adjacent to the aguada. The reservoir's artificial lining prevents dry season desiccation and enhances microfossil preservation. In 1998 a 335 cm sediment core was taken from the center of the reservoir and analyzed for pollen, microscopic charcoal, and total organic matter Core chronology, based on two AMS radiocarbon determinations, shows the record covers the period from A.D. 695 to present. Only the upper 113 cm contained well-preserved microfossils. The pollen record clearly documents a period of agricultural activity followed by abandonment and forest succession. In the agricultural period (A.D. 695-840), earn pollen is found in conjunction with disturbance indicators. After the abandonment at approximately, A.D. 840, the record is dominated by aquatic pollen types and corn pollen is absent. This shift in pollen spectra represents the end of the Classic period."	18	2	212-222	Yes	Wahl2007_194.iii	English	Guatemala	Aguada Zacatal Nakbe	17.669071	-89.792832	Lake Sediment Core	Stratagraphic Description	Not Reported	None	Stratigraphic description	Units	No		2							Not Reported	1690	1988	Neither	No	INTCAL04	No		Depth	No	1436	1436	608	34	112	5881	298	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Kennedy2008_103	2008	"Kennedy, L. M.; Horn, S. P."	"A late Holocene pollen and charcoal record from La Selva biological station, Costa Rica"			"Pollen and charcoal analysis of a 5.9-m-long sediment profile from a swamp on an alluvial terrace on the edge of La Selva biological station, Costa Rica (10 degrees 26'23 N, 84 degrees 00'24 W, 36 m asl), documents three millennia of human and natural disturbance within a lowland tropical rain forest. The record indicates that the highly diverse rain forest that presently surrounds the Cantarrana swamp regrew following forest clearing and maize agriculture that ended only a few centuries ago. The first maize pollen appears in sediments deposited \~ 1070 calendar-year BP. Older sediments below the 'maize zone' contain macroscopic charcoal, abundant microscopic charcoal, and possible pollen indicators of forest clearance, perhaps signaling local cultivation of root crops that left no pollen in the sediments. Interpretation of local archaeology indicates that La Selva reserve may have been most heavily populated during the El Bosque and La Selva regional archaeological phases from 2250-950 yr BP. However, the distribution of maize pollen in the sediments is clear evidence that the reserve was also occupied during the later La Cabana phase (950-400 yr BP), from which few artifacts have yet surfaced.

It has an area of 36,735 m(2) and maximum depth of 25 m. Four sediment cores along a depth transect provide a 4-ka record of the evolution of the eastern deep basin (core PC1 at 25 m depth) and the shallow margin (cores PC2-4 at 0.25-5 m depth). PC1 shows the effect of water-level rise and flooding of the shallow margin (2.8-1.8 ka) through a lithological (organic to carbonate) and geochemical (mu XRF; decreased Ti, Fe, K and Ca) change along with a reduction in sediment accumulation (0.2927 to 0.0343 cm year(-1)). This change in sedimentation matches basal ages of PC2 and PC4 at 2.5 and 1.8 ka respectively, indicating water-level rise and flooding of the shallowly sloped margin which is within estimates of Holocene sea-level rise thus indicating connection with the aquifer. Corroborating evidence for connection with the aquifer comes from water-level monitoring (30 min intervals; 6 months December 12, 2018 to June 6, 2019) which shows a semi-diurnal tidal fluctuation (1-1.5 cm). Droughts have been thoroughly discussed as a proponent of the decline of the Classic Maya, with lakes being inferred to be isolated from the aquifer and experiencing water level drawdown. However, during the Classic Maya droughts lake drawdown in Pac Chen would be minimal, and there is no evidence of a water level drop in our lake margin stratigraphy (PC2-4). Water mass characteristics measured in March 2016 (temperature, conductivity) indicate some hydrological isolation from the aquifer. This isolation would have allowed for recording of environmental changes, but also likely changed through time as flooding of the lake progressed. The shallow margin core PC4, however, recorded several rapid drops in K and Fe from 1100 to 975, and 925-875 yr BP, which we interpret as periods of reduced inputs of terrigenous weathering during times of reduced rainfall and runoff.

The cenote is 8.6 km from the Caribbean coast and its formation and evolution have been largely affected by sea-level change. The base of the core dates to 6,940-6,740 cal year BP and overlying sediments were deposited rapidly over the subsequent \~ 200 years. The pollen record shows that the cenote evolved from a marsh dominated by red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and fern (Polypodiaceae) to an open-water system. These vegetation changes were controlled by water level and salinity and are thus useful indicators of past sea level. At the base, the $\delta$13Corg isotopic ratios reveal the influence of terrestrial vegetation (-29‰ VPDB), but shift to more negative values up-core (-33‰), indicating an influence from particulate matter in the flooded cenote pool. Although microfossil populations were nearly absent through most of the core, the microfossil assemblage in the upper 6 cm of the core is dominated by the juvenile foraminifer Ammonia tepida and the thecamoebian genus Centropyxis. These populations indicate openwater conditions in the cenote and a major environmental shift around 6,600 cal year BP, which is related to sea-level rise in the Caribbean basin. These data fit well with previously established sea-level curves for the Caribbean Sea. Our reconstruction of the environmental history of Cenote Aktun Ha helps elucidate the floral and hydrological history of the region, and highlights the utility of cenote sediments for studying the Holocene sea-level history of the Caribbean Sea. \textcopyright Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008."	42	2	199-213	Yes	Gabriel2009_66.vii	English	Mexico	Cenote Aktun Ha	20.274287	-87.486249	Lake Sediment Core	Stratagraphic Description	Not Reported	None	Stratigraphic description	Units	No									"Wood Fragments, Twigs, Shells"	N/A	N/A	Neither	No	INTCAL04	Not Applicable		Depth	No	1209	1209	495	39	132	5135	5	Yucatán moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Fire history across the Little Ice Age in southern Pacific Costa Rica	Journal of Paleolimnology	10.1007/s10933-020-00118-0	"We present two high-resolution records of Late Holocene (Meghalayan) fire history from lakes in the lowlands of southern Pacific Costa Rica and compare them with evidence of pre-Columbian agriculture in the same cores and with records of regional paleoclimate. Macroscopic charcoal influx at Laguna Danta and Laguna Carse shows several major and minor peaks for approximately the last ~ 800 years, but does not show the decline at the time of the Little Ice Age and Spanish contact evident in other charcoal records from the region. Stable carbon isotope values in sediments indicate that agricultural activity at Laguna Danta declined following the onset of the Little Ice Age, but the association between fire and indigenous agriculture at the study sites is not strong. Instead, drought appears to be a primary driver of fire in the lowlands of southern Pacific Costa Rica. Some peaks in macroscopic charcoal at Laguna Danta coincide with shifts in the mean latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the Caribbean as reconstructed from the Cariaco Ti record.

Pollen assemblages demonstrate that a mesic forest had been largely established by ∼ 11 250 cal. yr BP, but sediment properties indicate that lake level was more than 35 m below modern stage. From 11 250 to 10 350 cal. yr BP, during the Preboreal period, lithologic changes in sediments from deep-water cores ( \textgreater 50m below modern water level) indicate several wet-dry cycles that suggest distinct changes in effective moisture. Four dry events (designated PBE1 -4) occurred centred at 11 200, 10 900, 10 700 and 10 400 cal. yr BP and correlate with similar variability observed in the Cariaco Basin titanium record and glacial meltwater pulses into the Gulf of Mexico.

Furthermore, lowland Neotropical climate during the late deglacial and early Holocene period appears to be tightly linked to climate change in the high-latitude North Atlantic.

Enquist2001_54	2001	"Enquist, B. J.; Leffler, A. J."	Long-term tree ring chronologies from sympatric tropical dry-forest trees: individualistic responses to climatic variation	Journal of Tropical Ecology		"The influence of local precipitation and temperature on long-term growth dynamics of two seasonally dry tropical forest trees, Capparis indica and Genipa americana, were investigated in Guanacaste province on the northwest Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Increment cores were collected and the relationships with environmental variables examined. These growth rings provide a long term (circa 85-year) record of tree growth for the two species with contrasting phenologies. Annual growth, in both species, was dependent upon annual and/or monthly rainfall variation in local precipitation but less so on temperature. For each species, however, patterns of growth reflected unique degrees of sensitivity to monthly rainfall and rainfall during previous years. It is hypothesized that such differences were due to the rooting depth of these species. The literature also indicated similar diverse cambial growth responses by tropical trees to variation in annual and monthly climate. Variation in longer term fluctuations in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as measured by the El Nino Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation, significantly influenced local precipitation in Guanacaste only during the wettest portion of the wet season. This temporal sensitivity may have differentially influenced the long term growth of some tropical tree species but not others. These results, together, support the hypothesis that tropical tree species respond individually to variation in local and regional climate and some tropical assemblages may be structured by species-specific differences in water use."	17		41-60	No	Enquist2001_54	English	Costa Rica	Area de Conservacion Guanacaste	10.75	-85.5	Dendro	Dendro	Climate;Precipitation;Seasonality	Water	Air-dried	No. of	No							1			1912	1997	Top and Bottom	Yes	No	Not Applicable		Time	No	1713	1713	864	2	9	9030	100	Central American dry forests	Tropical & Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests

Urquhart2009_183	2009	"Urquhart, G. R."	Paleoecological record of hurricane disturbance and forest regeneration in Nicaragua	Quaternary International	10.1016/j.quaint.2008.05.012	"Studying infrequent phenomena (e.g. hurricanes) and slow processes (e.g. forest regeneration) greatly challenges the ecological techniques of real-time studies. By combining the two relatively new approaches of paleotempestology and fine-resolution palynology, this study provides insight into the impacts of hurricanes and the post-hurricane regeneration of forests. I analyzed a 5-m sediment core from a swamp lagoon on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua that covered the entire 8000-yr history of the swamp [Urquhart, G. R., 1997. Disturbance and regeneration of swamp forests in Nicaragua: evidence from Ecology and Paleoecology. Ph.D. Dissertation, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA]. X-rays revealed a sand layer dating to c. 3300 BP of the type deposited by hurricanes. Pollen analyses showed this sand layer was followed by major changes in vegetation and fires. This pattern is identical to the wake of Hurricane Joan, which struck the area in 1988 and left 90,000 hectares of damaged swamp forest that burned shortly after. After the prehistoric hurricane, forest vegetation did not return until 500 yr later, due to repeated burning. This parallel event of the past illustrates a possible course for modern forest regeneration. As a counterpart to direct ecological analysis, fine-resolution paleoecological study can provide great insight for the study of rare events and slow processes. \textcopyright 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA."	195	43862	88-97	Yes	Urquhart2009_183.iv	English	Nicaragua	Centro Negro	12.045139	-83.927561	Lake Sediment Core	Organic Matter	Not Reported	None	"550 ◦C, LOI"	%	No		5							"Wood fragments,"	-6070	-870	Top and Bottom	Not Reported	INTCAL98	Not Reported		Depth	No	3416	3416	1440	70	259	5332	8	Isthmian-Atlantic moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

This cooling event is named La Chonta stadial after the bog at 2310 m altitude, located at the actual lower to upper montane forest boundary. High-resolution pollen analysis revealed that between 11,070±130 (AMS 14C age) and 10,400 yr B.P. (interpolated age) vegetation comparable to present-day subalpine forest occurred about 300-400 m lower than in the previous warmer interval, and 600 to 700 m lower than at present time. The radiocarbon dates are close to the earlier estimated ages of 11,080-10,500 yr B.P. for this interval, based on interpolation and pollen concentration rates (Hooghiemstra et al., 1992). The downslope shift of the upper forest line indicates an estimated temperature drop of 2-3°C during the La Chonta stadial. The local vegetation development is indicative of a drier climate. From 10,400 to 9800±120 yr B.P. (AMS 14C age) subalpine rain forest was replaced by upper montane forest, a transitional period to Holocene environmental conditions. \textcopyright 1995."	117	43862	73-80	No	Islebe1995_91	English	Costa Rica	La Chonta	9.683333	-83.95	Lake Sediment Core	Pollen	Temperature;Vegetation	Forests;Water	Not Reported	%	No		2							Not Reported	-9120	-7850	Top	Yes	Not Reported	Not Reported	"These datesreveal a temporal resolution of 55 years in pollenzones 5 and 6, using a linear accumulation rate."

"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"	10.1016/S0031-0182(97)81129-7	"A survey of the dominant vegetative cover of a large domed coastal swamp near Changuinola in the Province of Bocas del Toro, Panama, has been undertaken as an initial step in reconstructing the Holocene history of peat accumulation on this coast. Seven phasic communities of peat-forming vegetation are defined and mapped: (1) Rhizophora mangle mangrove swamp; (2) mixed back-mangrove swamp; (3) Raphia taedigera palm swamp; (4) mixed forest swamp; (5) Campnosperma panamensis forest swamp; (6) Sawgrass ± stunted forest swamp; (7) Myrica-Cyrilla bog-plain. Pollen extracted from surface peat samples and collected from dominant vegetation, at representative sites, is used to prepare a pollen profile of each phasic community. These profiles are then compared to pollen distribution in 2 peat cores, one from the deep central part of the deposit and the second from a site near the marine margin, in order to construct a history, by floral succession, of the 4000 year evolution of the deposit. The Changuinola mire originated as freshwater palm and hardwood forest swamps that developed in close proximity to both the Changuinola River mouth, probably behind a barrier bar and freshwater lagoon system adjacent to a low energy, mangrove-dominated bay. The early swamp was likely drained to the southeast by brackish blackwater creeks much as it is today, and formerly extended considerably farther in the direction of Almirante Bay. The palm swamp was succeeded by hardwood forest swamp dominated by a very limited number of specialized species, only one of which (Campnosperma panamensis) is prone to forming monospecific stands. Increasing accumulation of woody peat promoted by the everwet climate impeded drainage of the mire, leading to doming, increased oligotrophy, and establishment of bog-plain conditions in a manner similar to that described by the Anderson model of succession in the coastal swamps of Malaysia and Indonesia. Development of the Changuinola mire did not require the initial mangrove phase which is common to the peat swamps of southeast Asia, as the palm Raphia taedigera is able to colonise and institute peat accumulation in a variety of freshwater and brackish environments."	128	43922	301-338	No	Phillips1997_143	English	Panama	Bocas del Toro	9.333333	-82.333333	Peat Sediment Core	Pollen	Vegetation	Forests;Water	Acetolysis + wet sieving >0.25um	%	No		4							Peat	-2060	1950	Neither	Not Reported	Not Reported	Not Reported		Depth	No	3067	3067	960	97	423	3112	1	Mesoamerican Gulf-Caribbean mangroves	Mangroves

Our results document lake level fluctuations in this lowland Neotropical region that were related to glacial-to-interglacial climate change during the Late Pleistocene. A bathymetric survey of Lake Pet \' e n Itz \' a (area = 100 km2) revealed a maximum water depth of ∼160 m and the existence of a deep cryptodepression that extends 50 m below modern sea level. The great depth suggests that the basin held water even during arid conditions associated with full glacial periods. Lake Pet \' e n Itz \' a may thus possess the only long continuous lacustrine sediment record of Late Pleistocene environmental and climate change in the lowland Neotropics. Two seismic reflection campaigns imaged the subsurface basin sediments that overlie basement. The sediment package was divided into four major seismic sequences (T, G, R, and B). Sequences are separated by unconformities that represent depositional cycles related to lake level fluctuations. Sediments of the uppermost sequence (T) were recovered and radiocarbon-dated in Kullenberg piston cores taken along a water depth transect. Seismic profiles reveal a basin-wide paleoshoreline just below sequence T at ∼56 m below present lake level. This constructional feature formed during a lowstand of the last glacial period when the lake was reduced to only ∼13 \% of its present volume. In cores taken landward of the paleoshoreline, Late Glacial-age deposits consist of paleosols, indicating subaerial exposure. Basinward of the shoreline, sediments are composed of dense gypsum sands and interbedded silty clays, reflecting authigenic gypsum formation under arid climate conditions. The top of the soil horizon and cessation of gypsum precipitation are represented by a strong seismic reflection (t). It marks the base of the uppermost seismic sequence T and is dated in several cores between ∼11.1 and 10.2 cal kyr BP. Lake level rose quickly at this time in response to a shift from arid-to-humid climate conditions at the Late Glacial/Early Holocene transition. We infer a similar sediment response to climate variations in the older stratigraphic sequences (G, R, and B), related to earlier glacial-to-interglacial and stadial-to- interstadial cycles. Older sequences are also distinguished from one another by erosional unconformities that probably represent major lake level falls. Future recovery of the older stratigraphic record by drilling in Lake Pet \' e n Itz \' a will provide ages for these older units and enable us to test the depositional model inferred from seismic stratigraphy. \textcopyright 2005 Elsevier B.V.

High latitude paleoclimate reconstructions reveal a warmer northern hemisphere during the mid-Holocene, yet paleoclimate records from tropical Central America are lacking, especially seasonally resolved reconstructions needed to resolve seasonal shifts. Here we reconstruct mid-Holocene precipitation using high-resolution (sub-annual to biannual) stable isotope ratios (oxygen and carbon) extracted from a speleothem recovered from Belize to investigate the frequency and magnitude of precipitation variability. We found a slight increase in precipitation during the mid-Holocene in Belize with less variability compared to the late-Holocene. This increase in precipitation may be a result of the expansion of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH), which strengthens the Caribbean Lower Level Jet, enhancing westward advection of atmospheric moisture to Belize. The decrease in precipitation variability could be derived from a northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) placing Belize within the bounds of the ITCZ for a longer period each year. Time series analysis reveals periodicities of 200–250 years which correspond to the Suess solar cycle. The additional periods of \~  100 and \~  50 years also have origins in solar irradiance. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV; also known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)), long recognized as important drivers of precipitation variability in the region, are present but only at the 90 \% significance level.

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV; also known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)), long recognized as important drivers of precipitation variability in the region, are present but only at the 90 \% significance level. We posit that the reduced influence of the NAO and AMV could be caused by the northerly migration of the ITCZ during the mid-Holocene. \textcopyright 2016 Elsevier B.V."	463		103-111	Yes	Pollock2016_149.ii	English	Belize	Chen Ha Cave	17	-89	Speleothem	δ13C	Climate;Precipitation	Water	Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finnigan) Delta V 3 keV Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer	VPDB ‰	No						11				-4986	-2756	Top and Bottom	Not Reported	Not Reported	Not Applicable		Time	No	1973	1973	780	46	170	5254	397	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Although long-term precessionally-driven changes in temperature and precipitation have been demonstrated using tropical sediment records, responses to abrupt climate changes, e.g. the cooling of Heinrich stadials or warmings of the deglaciation, are poorly documented. The best predictions of future forest responses to ongoing warming will rely on evaluating the influences of both abrupt and long-term climate changes on past ecosystems. A sedimentary sequence recovered from Lake Pet \' e n-Itz \' a , Guatemalan lowlands, provided a natural archive of environmental history. Pollen and charcoal analyses were used to reconstruct the vegetation and climate history of the area during the last 86,000 years. We found that vegetation composition and air temperature were strongly influenced by millennial-scale changes in the North Atlantic Ocean. Whereas Greenland warm interstadials were associated with warm and relatively wet conditions in the Central American lowlands, cold Greenland stadials, especially those associated with Heinrich events, caused extremely dry and cold conditions. Even though the vegetation seemed to have been highly resilient, plant associations without modern analogs emerged mostly following sharp climate pulses of either warmth or cold, and were paralleled by exceptionally high rates of ecological change. Although pulses of temperature change are evident in this 86,000-year record none matched the rates projected for the 21st Century. According to our findings, the ongoing rapid warming will cause no-modern-analog communities, which given the improbability of returning to lower-than-modern CO 2 levels, anthropogenic barriers to migration, and increased anthropogenic fires, will pose immense threats to the biodiversity of the region. \textcopyright 2012 Elsevier Ltd."	38		63-75	Yes	Correa-Metrio2012_33.i	English	Guatemala	Lago Peten Itza	17	-89.5	Lake Sediment Core	Magnetic Susceptibility	Not Reported	None	Not Reported	Not Reported	No		21							Charcoal	-82000	1950	Neither	No	Fairbanks et al. 2005	No		Time	No	1860	1860	756	41	153	5571	226	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Although it generally is believed that no single factor was responsible, a commonly accepted cause is environmental degradation as a product of large-scale deforestation. To date, the most compelling scientific evidence used to support this hypothesis comes from the archaeological site of Copan, Honduras, where the analysis of a sediment core suggested a dramatic increase in forest clearance in the Late Classic period (A.D. 600-900). By contrast, in the work presented here, the authors' analysis of a longer sediment core demonstrates that forest cover increased from A.D. 400 to A.D. 900, with arboreal pollen accounting for 59.8-71.0 \% of the pollen assemblage by approximately A.D. 780-980. The highest levels of deforestation are found about 900 B.C. when, at its peak, herb pollen made up 89.8 \% of the assemblage. A second, although less pronounced, period of elevated deforestation peaked at approximately A.D. 400 when herb pollen reached 65.3 \% of the assemblage. The first deforestation event likely coincided with the widespread adoption of agriculture, a pattern found elsewhere in Mesoamerica. The second period of forest clearance probably was associated with the incursion of Maya speakers into the Copan Valley and their subsequent construction of the earliest levels of the Copan Acropolis. These results refute the former hypothesis that the ancient Maya responded to their increasingly large urban population by exhausting, rather than conserving, natural resources."	107	3	1017-1022	No	McNeil2010_123	English	Honduras	Petapilla	14.870485	-89.117181	Lake Sediment Core	Pollen	Vegetation;Agriculture	Forests;Land Use Change	"HCI, HF, ZnCI-2, Glycerin"	%	Agricultural Taxa;Decrease in Arboreal Taxa		6						1	"Peat, plant material, organic sediment, leaf fragments"	-720	2001	Bottom	Yes	Not Reported	No		Depth	Yes	1510	1510	719	20	74	7799	784	Central American pine-oak forests	Tropical & Subtropical Coniferous Forests

Here we apply hydrogen and carbon isotope compositions of plant wax lipids in two lake sediment cores to assess changes in water availability and land use in both the northern and southern Maya lowlands. We show that relatively more intense drying occurred in the southern lowlands than in the northern lowlands during the Terminal Classic period, consistent with earlier and more persistent societal decline in the south.

"Ancient Maya wetland management in two watersheds in Belize: Soils, water, and paleoenvironmental change"	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL	10.1016/j.quaint.2018.10.029	"We compare the geomorphology and soil of two ancient Maya wetland agricultural complexes in modern day Belize. This paper focuses on 3000 years of soil geomorphology and paleoecological change to determine the chronology of wetland formation and human use in this region. We also characterize Maya manipulation of the environment over time, especially considering times of ecological or climactic change in the late Holocene. This paper adds to our ongoing research in northwestern Belize, specifically within two recently explored wetland agricultural systems, Neuendorf and Sierra de Agua. Although they are 40 km from one another and in different watersheds, they have similar water chemistry and comparable soil, as well as comparable ancient Maya agricultural field and canal stratigraphy. The Neuendorf wetland fields and associated Maya house mounds and platforms are 1.5 km northeast of the well-studied Chan Cahal residential group/wetland agricultural fields. This ancient Maya settlement zone sits on a small limestone escarpment, about 7–24 m above sea level on the Belizean coastal plain. New trenches and vibracores from this wetland complex support our previous models of wetland formation and human use from the Late Preclassic to the end of the Classic.

Recent mapping, sediment coring, and formal excavation at Tikal, Guatemala, have markedly expanded our understanding of ancient Maya water and land use. Among the landscape and engineering feats identified are the largest ancient dam identified in the Maya area of Central America; the posited manner by which reservoir waters were released; construction of a cofferdam for dredging the largest reservoir at Tikal; the presence of ancient springs linked to the initial colonization of Tikal; the use of sand filtration to cleanse water entering reservoirs; a switching station that facilitated seasonal filling and release; and the deepest rock-cut canal segment in the Maya Lowlands. These engineering achievements were integrated into a system that sustained the urban complex through deep time, and they have implications for sustainable construction and use of water management systems in tropical forest settings worldwide."	109	31	12408-12413	No	Scarborough2012_166	English	Guatemala	Tikal	17.224425	-89.613073	Lake Sediment Core	Stratagraphic Description	Not Reported	None	Not Reported	Units	No	1	1							"Organic matter, Charcoal"	-7010	1950	Neither	No	Not Reported	Not Reported		Depth	No	1644	1644	633	38	135	5432	194	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Today, Lake Salpeten is a brackish, calcium sulfate lake near saturation surrounded by tropical semievergreen forest. The basal pollen record depicts sparse juniper scrub surrounding a lake basin that held ephermal pools and halophytic marshes. The lake rapidly deepened to \textgreater 27 m in the early Holocene and may have been meromictic, because nearly 2 m of gypsum mush was deposited. Mesic forests were quickly established and persisted until the Maya entered the district 3000 yr ago and caused extensive deforestation. Any climatic information contained in the pollen record of the Maya period is thus masked, but a regional pollen sequence linked to the archaeological record is substantiated because environmental disturbance was pervasive. Local intensification of occupation and population growth are seen as an increased deposition of pollen of agricultural weeds and colluviation into the lake, while the Classic Maya collapse is marked by a temporary decline in Compositae pollen. Effects of perturbations induced by the Maya persist in the pollen and limnetic record 400 yr after the Spanish conquest. \textcopyright 1987."	28	3	407-414	No	Leyden1987_118	English	Guatemala	Lago Salpeten	16.983333	-89.666667	Lake Sediment Core	Pollen	Vegetation	Forests;Land Use Change	Not Reported	%	No	1								Not Reported	Not Reported	Not Reported	Neither	Not Reported	Not Reported	Not Applicable		Depth	No	1756	1756	708	37	139	5736	114	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Late Classic sedimentation rates are rapid, but an anthropogenically derived colluvium layer is lacking, Initial vegetation was medium semi-deciduous and swamp forest. Forest clearance began 1650 B.C. (Early Preclassic) and maize first occurred at 850 B.C. (Middle Preclassic). Lakeside milpas existed until A.D. 720 (Late Classic) and then were moved from the city center as urbanization intensified and Lake Coba was diked as a reservoir. Coba was at most briefly vacated during the Classic Collapse and was abandoned after A.D. 1240, although some habitation persisted. The paleoecological record matches the archaeological history for Coba, but pervasive disturbance muted the climatic signal, as the Late Classic drought is barely evident. The question whether economic trees were maintained within the city is unresolved, Maize cultivation allowed the Maya to develop a complex society and support a large population, but dependence on maize was ultimately doomed by variable rainfall.

Recovery of mangroves and tropical forests occurred from \~ 4500 cal. yr BP, suggesting moister conditions. Agricultural activities are recorded around \~ 4900, 4700 and 2400 cal. yr BP, although human occupation was scarce in the mangrove area.

Terminal Classic drought in the northern Maya lowlands inferred from multiple sediment cores in Lake Chichancanab (Mexico)	Quaternary Science Reviews	10.1016/j.quascirev.2004.10.013	"We present new density records from sediment cores taken along a depth transect in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico. The data reveal in great detail the climatic events that comprised the Terminal Classic Drought (TCD) and coincided with the demise of Classic Maya civilization between ca 750 and 1050 AD. In shallow-water cores, the TCD is marked by a condensed gypsum horizon. In deeper-water sections it is expanded and represented by numerous interbedded gypsum and organic-rich strata. The TCD was not a single, two-century-long megadrought, but rather consisted of a series of dry events separated by intervening periods of relatively moister conditions. We estimate the TCD occurred between ca 770 and 1100 AD and included an early phase (ca 770-870 AD) and late phase (ca 920-1100 AD). The intervening 50-year period (ca 870-920 AD) was relatively moister. Each dry phase is represented by multiple gypsum (density) bands interbedded with organic-rich sediment that indicate alternating dry and wet conditions. Spectral analysis revealed significant periods around 213, 50, and 27 years. Despite uncertainty regarding the ages of these events, their pattern is robust and generally consistent with other proxy records under the same climate regime, such as the marine Cariaco Basin off northern Venezuela (Science 299 (2003) 1731). \textcopyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Phase 2 (2800-4300 Cal yr BP) has both freshwater testate amoebae (Centropyxis spp. 40 \% ) and P. simplex (42 \% ), which indicates a slight freshening of the meteoric lens to 1.5-2 g L-1.

This last faunal shift represents the initiation of modern freshwater conditions in the cave (1.5 g L-1). This final freshening is synchronous with a significant reduction in the C/N ratio (e.g., Core 2: ∼27 to 19), which suggests an expansion of primary productivity in the adjacent cenote. The $\delta$15N values ranged from 1.5 to 3.5‰ with observed cycles likely from intervals of increased terrestrial OM input into the cave during high rainfall events (e.g., hurricanes). The observed paleoenvironmental shifts in the cave correlate well with regional precipitation patterns, aquifer recharge, and storm activity caused by southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Therefore, regional climate change impacted eastern Yucatan groundwater during the mid to late Holocene. However, decelerating Holocene sea-level rise and aquifer occlusion are likely contributing factors. These results demonstrate that underwater cave sediments and microfossils can be useful proxies for aquifer evolution and climate change. \textcopyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd."	29	19-20	2788-2798	Yes	van Hengstum2010_184.iii	English	Mexico	Aktun Ha Cave	20.274178	-87.486259	Cave Sediment	δ13C	Climate;Precipitation;Sea Level	Water	HCL	VPDB %	No										Not Reported	Not Reported	Neither	Not Reported	INTCAL04	Not Reported		Depth	Yes	1209	1209	495	39	132	5135	5	Yucatán moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

The $\delta$15N values ranged from 1.5 to 3.5‰ with observed cycles likely from intervals of increased terrestrial OM input into the cave during high rainfall events (e.g., hurricanes). The observed paleoenvironmental shifts in the cave correlate well with regional precipitation patterns, aquifer recharge, and storm activity caused by southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Therefore, regional climate change impacted eastern Yucatan groundwater during the mid to late Holocene.

Paleoclimate records from the circum-Caribbean have shown evidence of severe, regional droughts that contributed to the collapse of the Mayan Civilization, but there are few records of these droughts in southern Central America and no records of their effects on prehistoric populations in the region. Here we present a high-resolution lake sediment record of prehistoric agricultural activities using bulk sediment stable carbon isotopes from Laguna Zoncho, Costa Rica. We find isotopic evidence that agriculture was nearly absent from the watershed approximately 220 years prior to the Spanish arrival in Costa Rica and identify two distinct periods of agricultural decline, 1150-970 and 860-640cal yr BP, which correspond to severe droughts in central Mexico. We attribute decreases in agriculture to a weakened Central American monsoon, which would have shortened the growing season at Laguna Zoncho, reduced crop yields, and negatively affected prehistoric populations. \textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Ltd."	73		196-200	No	Taylor2013_178	English	Costa Rica	Laguna Zoncho	8.813	-82.963	Lake Sediment Core	δ13C	Catchment Erosion;Land Use Change	Forests;Land Use Change	1 N hydrochloric acid	VPDB ‰	No		13						1	Not Reported	800	1600	Not Reported	Not Reported	INTCAL04	Not Reported		Time	No	2841	2841	1165	40	166	6482	1094	Talamancan montane forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

The geochemical records show changing aquifer salinity spanning the last similar to 8.5 cal kyrs BP and interrelationships with Holocene climate trends (wet and dry periods). During the wet mid-Holocene, the salinity of the meteoric Water Mass (WM; at 7.8-8.3 cal kyrs BP) was relatively high at 1.5-2.7 ppt and then became less saline (1.0-1.5 ppt) during the last similar to 7000 yrs as climate became progressively drier. High salinity of the meteoric WM during the wet mid-Holocene is attributed to increased turbulent mixing between the meteoric and underlying marine WM. Increased precipitation, in terms of amount, frequency, and intensity (e.g. hurricanes) causes higher flow of meteoric water towards the coast and mixing at the halocline, a phenomenon recorded with recent instrumental monitoring of the aquifer.

Quantitative estimates of tropical temperature change in lowland Central America during the last 42 ka	Earth and Planetary Science Letters	10.1016/j.epsl.2016.01.001	"Determining the magnitude of tropical temperature change during the last glacial period is a fundamental problem in paleoclimate research. Large discrepancies exist in estimates of tropical cooling inferred from marine and terrestrial archives. Here we present a reconstruction of temperature for the last 42 ka from a lake sediment core from Lake Pet \' e n Itz \' a , Guatemala, located at 17°N in lowland Central America. We compared three independent methods of glacial temperature reconstruction: pollen-based temperature estimates, tandem measurements of $\delta$18O in biogenic carbonate and gypsum hydration water, and clumped isotope thermometry. Pollen provides a near-continuous record of temperature change for most of the glacial period but the occurrence of a no-analog pollen assemblage during cold, dry stadials renders temperature estimates unreliable for these intervals. In contrast, the gypsum hydration and clumped isotope methods are limited mainly to the stadial periods when gypsum and biogenic carbonate co-occur. The combination of palynological and geochemical methods leads to a continuous record of tropical temperature change in lowland Central America over the last 42 ka. Furthermore, the gypsum hydration water method and clumped isotope thermometry provide independent estimates of not only temperature, but also the $\delta$18O of lake water that is dependent on the hydrologic balance between evaporation and precipitation over the lake surface and its catchment. The results show that average glacial temperature was cooler in lowland Central America by 5-10 °C relative to the Holocene. The coldest and driest times occurred during North Atlantic stadial events, particularly Heinrich stadials (HSs), when temperature decreased by up to 6 to 10 °C relative to today. This magnitude of cooling is much greater than estimates derived from Caribbean marine records and model simulations.The extreme dry and cold conditions during HSs in the lowland Central America were associated with fresh water forcing in the North Atlantic, which led to reduced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, cooling of the North Atlantic, southern advance of sea-ice, and southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Although some models correctly predict the sign of temperature and precipitation changes, they consistently underestimate the degree of observed cooling and decreased precipitation over land in lowland Central America. \textcopyright 2016 Elsevier B.V."	438		37-46	No	Grauel2016_67	English	Guatemala	Lago Peten Itza	17.00162	-89.476844	Lake Sediment Core	Magnetic Susceptibility	Not Reported	None	Not Reported	SI	No		1							Not Reported	-40000	2000	Not Reported	Not Reported	INTCAL09	Not Reported		Time	No	1846	1846	751	40	151	5579	234	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Several droughts occurred during this interval, some of which are evident in other paleoclimatic records from the Caribbean region. We identified taxa that are characteristic of paleoecological change, such as Moraceae, Ficus and Asteraceae, among others. Zea mays and other taxa reflect the Maya occupation and its impact on the landscape. Droughts, as inferred from vegetational and sedimentary changes, occurred during the intervals of 4700-3600 cal yr BP, 3400-2500 cal yr BP, 2300-2100 cal yr BP, 1900-1700 cal yr BP, 1400-1300 cal yr BP, 730 cal yr BP and 560 cal yr BP. During these periods, tropical forest taxa elements declined (Moraceae, Brosimum alicastrum, Ficus and Fabaceae) and secondary elements increased (Asteraceae, Mimosoidae-Acacia, Chenopodiaceae Vent. and Poaceae), as did local aquatic elements (Botryococcus). Zea mays appeared 4100 cal yr BP, and other secondary elements, such as Asteraceae, Mimosoideae-Acacia, and Chenopodiaceae Vent, increased.

Geochemical data from published 210Pb-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta 13C to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30-465 Mg ha-1, by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m-2 year-1) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased Corg concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased Corg burial rates. Lower Corg concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of Corg than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher Corg burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. Corg accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of Corg stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried Corg inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts."	630		1628-1640	Yes	Ruiz-Fernández2018_164.iv	English	Mexico	PUPA	19.703751	-87.484473	Saltmarsh Sediment Core	Geochemistry	Sea Level	Water	Elemental analyser	%	No				Not Reported					Not Reported	1983	2012	Top and Bottom	Not Reported	Not Reported	Not Applicable		Depth|Time	No	1289	1289	534	35	128	5381	1	Mesoamerican Gulf-Caribbean mangroves	Mangroves

This is the first study of the Lacandon area aimed at reconstructing late Holocene environmental history. The basal section of the core yielded an AMS date of 2020 14C years B.P. The Naja pollen record shows that the lower montane rain forest characterized by Moraceae, Mimosoideae, Leguminosae and Combretaceae/Melastomataceae, coexisted with a pine-oak forest throughout the late Holocene. No Zea mays pollen was found during routine pollen counts, but the presence of both secondary pollen taxa and abundant charcoal particles suggest some degree of regional human impact.

These changes are often recorded in historical accounts and official records; however, these are sparse, incomplete, and have been lost over the passage of time. Here, we present a high-resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstruction for Cenote Kail (Guatemala) since the Spanish Conquest, to provide additional evidence of land use changes from an integrated multi-proxy perspective. We analysed: (i) fossil pollen; (ii) macroscopic and microscopic charcoal; and (iii) dung fungal spores (Sporormiella) from a lake sediment core extracted from Cenote Kail in the Cuchumatanes highlands, combining these analyses with remotely sensed satellite data. We reconstructed: (i) forest composition and dynamics; (ii) burning, (iii) fauna abundance, and (iv) agricultural activities. High resolution age-depth modelling was conducted using a combination of 210Pb and 14C dates. The high temporal resolution enabled a novel integrated validation of the charcoal data sets with remotely sensed satellite data and the historical record. Three stages of floral compositional change were discerned from the palynological assemblage data encompassing: (i) the decline of mixed hard wood forests (MHWF), associated with the building of new settlements, agriculture and timber extraction for fuel (1550–1675 ce); (ii) pastoral expansions involving the rearing of livestock (1700–1800 ce); and (iii) the expansions of urban settlements and increasing management of the land (1821–2015 ce). Seed predation is suggested as the dominant factor preventing MHWF from re-establishing in the Cuchumatanes Highlands over the past 500 years.

Paleoenvironments and human occupation in late-glacial Panama	Quaternary Research		"The first pollen and phytolith data covering the entire Pleistocene/Holocene transition from the lowlands of the Central American isthmus indicate that the forests of late-glacial Panama at an altitude of 650 m resembled those currently found at about 1500-1800 m.

Stable carbon isotopes (δ 13 C) of total organic carbon and long-chain n-alkanes as proxies for climate and environmental change in a sediment core from Lake Petén-Itzá	Journal of Paleolimnology	10.1007/s10933-017-9949-z	"Sediment core PI-6 from Lake Petén Itzá, Guatemala, possesses an ~85-ka record of climate and environmental change from lowland Central America. Variations in sediment lithology suggest large and abrupt changes in precipitation during the last glacial and deglacial periods, and into the early Holocene. We measured stable carbon isotope ratios of total organic carbon and long-chain n-alkanes from the core, the latter representing a largely allochthonous (terrestrial) source of organic matter, to reveal past shifts in the relative proportion of C3–C4 terrestrial biomass. We sought to test whether stable carbon isotope results were consistent with other paleoclimate proxies measured in the PI-6 core, and if extraction and isotope analysis of n-alkanes is warranted. The largest δ13C variations are associated with Heinrich Events. Carbon isotope values in sediments deposited during the last glacial maximum indicate moderate precipitation with little fluctuation. The deglacial was a period of pronounced climate variability, e.g. a relatively warm and moist Bølling–Allerød, but a cool and dry Younger Dryas. Arid periods of the deglacial were inferred from samples with high δ13C values in total organic carbon, which reflect times of greater proportions of C4 plants. These inferences are supported by stable isotope measurements on ostracod shells and relative abundance of grass pollen from the same depths in core PI-6. Similar trends in carbon stable isotopes measured on bulk organic carbon and n-alkanes suggest that carbon isotope measures on bulk organic carbon in sediments from this lake are sufficient to infer past climate-driven shifts in local vegetation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."	57	4	307-319	Yes	Mays2017_121.v	English	Guatemala	Lago Peten Itza	16.916667	-89.833333	Lake Sediment Core	Stratagraphic Description	Not Reported	None	Stratigraphic description	Units	No		36						1	Not Reported	-41000	2006	Neither	Yes	INTCAL13	No		Depth	No	1738	1738	690	36	144	5677	131	Petén-Veracruz moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

The record provides evidence of 3000 years of human occupation, forest clearance, agriculture and fires in the area. Laguna Zoncho is located 2 km from the Las Cruces Biological Station, and results are relevant to understanding the likely extent of prehistoric disturbance within the premontane rain forests of this biological reserve. Pollen grains of Zea mays in the basal sediments of the Zoncho core constitute the oldest botanical evidence of maize cultivation in southern Costa Rica. The presence of maize pollen in almost every sample analysed indicates nearly continuous occupation of the lake basin for 3000 years. Charcoal abundances and percentages of pollen grains and spores of forest and disturbance taxa fluctuate strongly downcore, reflecting variable intensities of past human impact. Forest clearance and burning by indigenous people were most marked between 3240 and 460 calibrated year BP. Sediments deposited subsequently indicate forest regeneration and few, if any, fires.

A chironomid-based reconstruction of late-Holocene climate and environmental change for southern Pacific Costa Rica	Holocene	10.1177/0959683616652702	"A lake sediment profile spanning the last \~ 3200 years from Laguna Zoncho in the southern Pacific region of Costa Rica was analyzed for sub-fossil chironomids. Notable shifts in chironomid assemblages occurred during the late-Holocene. A distinct chironomid community, dominated by Tanypodinae such as Procladius and Labrundinia, appeared after \~ 550 cal. yr BP ( \~ 1400 CE). Prior to this time, the chironomid assemblage was more diverse, with taxa such as Paratanytarsus, Tanytarsus type N, and Cladotanytarsus important constituents of the chironomid community. A chironomid-based inference model for mean annual air temperature (MAAT), developed using partial least squares (PLS 2-component), was applied to sub-fossil chironomid assemblages from Laguna Zoncho to reconstruct late-Holocene thermal variability for the region. The key findings from this study are as follows: (1) chironomid-inferred MAAT at \~ 2740–1220 cal. yr BP (790 BCE–730 CE) was 1.2°C higher than the late-Holocene ( \~ 3200 cal. yr BP to present in this study) average of 21.3°C; (2) MAAT at \~ 470–90 cal. yr BP (1480–1860 CE) was 1.3°C lower than the late-Holocene average, potentially reflecting ‘Little Ice Age' (LIA) cooling; and (3) evidence for an extended period of low lake levels between 1220 and 840 cal. yr BP (730–1110 CE) possibly indicated the influence of the Terminal Classic Drought (TCD) in southern Costa Rica.

Pollen evidence reveals that during the mid-Holocene ( \~ 8000-5500 cal yr B.P.) lowland tropical plant taxa were growing at elevations \~ 200-250 m higher than at present, suggesting conditions about 1.0 degrees C warmer than those prevailing today. Cloud forest genera (Liquidambar, Juglans, Alnus, Ulmus) were also more abundant in the mid-Holocene, indicating greater cloud cover during the dry season. A gradual cooling and drying trend began by \~ 5500 cal yr B.P., culminating in the modern forest composition by \~ 3500 cal yr B.P. A rise in pollen from weedy plant taxa associated with agriculture occurred \~ 5000 cal yr B.P., and pollen from Zea first appeared in the record at \~ 4440 cal yr B.P. Human impacts on local vegetation remained high throughout the late Holocene, but decreased abruptly following the Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption of Volcan Ilopango at \~ 1520 cal yr B.P.

Climate forcings on vegetation of the southeastern Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico) during the middle to late Holocene	"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology"	10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.01.014	"Climate and vegetation history from the Yucatán Peninsula, southeastern Mexico, are inferred from a mangrove sediment core deposited between the middle and late Holocene (~5600–1700 cal yr B.P.) in the Rio Hondo Delta. Fossil pollen and concentrations of Ca and Fe and Ca/Fe ratio in sediments are used to record changes in vegetation and climate. Palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic interpretations obtained from pollen abundances and associations and Fe/Ca ratio coincide with dynamics of major global forcings of climate change like ITCZ, ENSO and global cooling. Mesic conditions enabled tropical forest expansion during the middle Holocene (~5600–3650 cal yr B.P.), although there were periodic dry episodes at ~5200 cal yr B.P. and at ~4300 cal yr B.P. that caused disturbance and enabled herbaceous vegetation to expand. Changes in sedimentation and a gradual change from semi-evergreen to dry tropical forest occurred at ~3650 cal yr B.P., with increasing ENSO activity and southward migration of the ITCZ during transition of the middle to late Holocene. The driest period and lowest forest cover occurred between ~2600 and 2000 cal yr B.P.

Tropical forest and mangrove history from southeastern Mexico: a 5000 yr pollen record and implications for sea level rise	Vegetation History and Archaeobotany		"A 250 cm long core from El Palmar, a swamp area located along the Rio Hondo river in the south of the Yucatan Peninsula, near the Belizean border, reveals the environmental history of the mangrove and tropical forest of the last 5000 years. The period between 5000 and 4600 b.p. shows sandy deposits, which form the early infill and development of the swamp. A medium-statured tropical forest covered the area and members of the Moraceae and Fabacaeae dominated this early forest. The period between 4600 and 4000 b.p. presents a clear change to a mangrove system with Conocarpus erecta and Rhizophora mangle as dominant trees. This vegetational change is due to flooding of the Rio Hondo river, which deposits sediments of high salinity due to higher sea-level. The medium-statured forest became established at some distance from the swamp area. After 4400 b.p. C. erecta appears as the dominant mangrove species and the R. mangle stands are less predominant in the area.

Late Holocene environmental change in Lake Boquete and its watershed: human or natural causes?	Boletin de la Sociedad Geologica Mexicana	10.18268/BSGM2018v70n1a7	"A paleolimnological and environmental reconstruction of the volcanic Lake Boquete, in the northern highlands of Panama, was produced based on diatom, sediment, and charcoal analyses. The main aim of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the long-term anthropogenic effect in Lake Boquete and its watershed, a unique space (Gran Chiriquí region) where human occupation and nature have interacted since ~7000 yr BP (years Before Present). Our results indicate two main periods of environmental change. In the first period, from ~2840 to 1740 cal yr BP (calibrated years Before Present), the lake was under the influence of high-energy flow regimes and high erosion rates. Water pH was gradually changing from neutral to alkaline. There's evidence of fires with four main events, some appear to be natural as indicated by the proxies, while others seem to be associated with anthropic causes most likely related to intense periods of cultivation; a particularly intense fire event is identified at ~2607 cal yr BP. We infer that during this period the lake and its watershed were under intense human impact. In the second period, from ~1740 to 197 cal yr BP, the lake was under a steady low-energy flow regime, submerged vegetation was more abundant, and pH became more acidic, fire events were less frequent. We infer that these conditions were the result of land abandonment due to human migration to the lowlands. Notwithstanding intense and frequent dry climate spells during the second period, Lake Boquete water levels were not affected, and thus, this record suggest that the main cause of environmental and limnological change in Lake Boquete and its watershed has been anthropogenic activities. © 2018, Instituto de Geologã-a, Universidad Nacional Autãnoma de Mã ©xico."	70	1	121-131	Yes	Temoltzin-Loranca2018_180.iii	English	Panama	Boquete	8.88582	-82.499791	Lake Sediment Core	Stratagraphic Description	Not Reported	None	Stratagraphic Description	Units	No		3							Bulk sediments	-892	1752	Top and Bottom	Not Reported	INTCAL13	Not Reported		Depth	No	3751	3751	1320	102	466	3973	1859	Talamancan montane forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Our 4200-year record from Laguna Los Mangos begins 1000 to 2000 years earlier than other lake records from the region and provides the first microfossil and geochemical evidence of vegetation and fire prior to the establishment of maize agriculture.

Climate drying and associated forest decline in the lowlands of northern Guatemala during the late Holocene	Quaternary Research		"Palynological studies document forest disappearance during the late Holocene in the tropical Maya lowlands of northern Guatemala. The question remains as to whether this vegetation change was driven exclusively by anthropogenic deforestation, as previously suggested, or whether it was partly attributable to climate changes. We report multiple palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment proxies (pollen, geochemical, sedimentological) from sediment cores collected in Lake Peten Itza, northern Guatemala. Our data indicate that the earliest phase of late Holocene tropical forest reduction in this area started at \~ 4500 cal yr BP, simultaneous with the onset of a circum-Caribbean drying trend that lasted for \~ 1500 yr.

Avnery2011_18	2011	"Avnery, S.; Dull, R. A.; Keitt, T. H."	Human versus climatic influences on late-Holocene fire regimes in southwestern Nicaragua	The Holocene		"Fire regimes in the lowland Neotropics are affected both by anthropogenic land use practices and natural climate variability. In Central America it is widely recognized that fire has been used as an agricultural tool for thousands of years, but the role of anthropogenic ignition as a determinant of past biomass burning frequency and magnitude has been debated. Little is known about the effects of short-term climate variability on fire regimes in this region of the world because of both the low temporal resolution of the available charcoal records and the obfuscating effects of anthropogenic burning throughout the late Holocene. Here we reconstruct 1400 years of fire history and environmental change on Ometepe Island, Lake Nicaragua, and perform statistical wavelet analysis on multiple proxy records to identify natural cycles of environmental variability possibly related to climate forcing. Our results indicate that extensive indigenous burning and landscape modification largely mask any climate signal in the paleo-fire record from AD 580 to 1400, with the exception of the period AD 775-1000 where high wavelet power exists at scales of 2-24 years. This time period coincides with a severe, two-century long regional drought that has been identified at other locations in Central America. High wavelet power at climate-relevant scales after \~ AD 1400 in the Ometepe fire record suggests that periodic drought possibly caused by the El Nino Southern Oscillation and/or high-frequency solar cycles may have played a significant role in influencing the post-contact fire regime - a role that is largely concealed in the pre-European strata because of the overriding effects of anthropogenic burning."	21		699-706	Yes	Avnery2011_18.i	English	Nicaragua	Charco Verde	11.477574	-85.632578	Lake Sediment Core	Magnetic Susceptibility	Catchment Erosion;Climate;Precipitation	Land Use Change	Barrington MS2 and an MS2B sensor	k	Catchment Erosion		6							Terestrial Plant Macrofossils	580	2000	Bottom	Not Reported	INTCAL04	Not Reported		Time	No	1667	1667	848	4	23	9142	70	Costa Rican seasonal moist forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests

Analyses of sub-fossil chironomid assemblages, macroscopic charcoal, and bulk sediment geochemistry suggest that the glacial highlands in Chirripó National Park experienced notable hydroclimate variability, periodical burning by wildfires and climate-related vegetation change during the last ~8100 years. A single chironomid taxon, Procladius, most commonly associated with cold glacial lakes in Costa Rica, dominates the Holocene sub-fossil chironomid assemblage in Lago Ditkebi. Inferred from the proxy records, the interval between ~8100 and 5270 cal yr BP at the glacial highlands was relatively cold and dry with low effective moisture and limited fire activity. Cool and dry conditions were also observed between ~2820 cal yr BP and present but co-occurred with more frequent, low-severity fires. The highest fire frequency occurred between ~3300 and 1600 cal yr BP. The shifts in the chironomid assemblage and the low δ 13 C values detected between ~5270 and 2820 cal yr BP suggest a warm and wet climate and a decrease in abundance of Muhlenbergia, a C 4 grass during that time. Concurrent maxima in C/N, charcoal accumulation and the abundance of thermophilous chironomid taxon, Polypedilum N type, at ~5200 cal yr BP are indicative of an abrupt climate change event that was characterized by rapid warming, quickly increased effective moisture and intense wildfires in the glacial highlands of Costa Rica. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."	518		172-186	Yes	Wu2019_198.i	English	Costa Rica	Ditkebi	9.468532	-83.480059	Lake Sediment Core	Chironomids	Temperature;Climate	None	Walker (2001)	%	No		8							Not Reported	-6150	2014	Neither	Not Reported	INTCAL13	Not Reported		Time	No	2510	2510	1054	28	87	6856	3450	Talamancan montane forests	Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests
Taylor2013_177	2013	"Taylor, Z. P.; Horn, S. P.; Finkelstein, D. B."	Maize pollen concentrations in Neotropical lake sediments as an indicator of the scale of prehistoric agriculture	The Holocene		"We evaluated the potential of maize pollen concentrations in lake sediment profiles to serve as indicators of the extent of prehistoric agriculture in neotropical lake basins using records from a network of five sediment cores recovered from Laguna Zoncho, Costa Rica. The watershed of this small (0.75 ha) lake in the Diquis archaeological region has a c. 3000 year history of prehistoric agriculture and subsequent forest recovery, as documented through previous studies of pollen, charcoal, diatoms, and phosphorus fractions in a single core recovered from the center of the lake. In our new network of cores, we compared maize pollen concentrations with two independent proxies for the scale of agriculture in the same cores: abundance of organic matter (OM), which is an indicator of soil erosion, and bulk sediment stable carbon isotope ratios of organic matter ( delta 13COM), which reflect the proportion of forested and cleared land within the watershed.

Late Holocene hydroclimate variability in Costa Rica: Signature of the terminal classic drought and the Medieval Climate Anomaly in the northern tropical Americas	Quaternary Science Reviews	10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.04.023	"In the northern tropical Americas (Neotropics), notable hydrological variability has been documented in multi-proxy paleoclimate records between similar to 600 and 1200 CE. This interval generally overlaps with the Maya Terminal Classic Drought (TCD: similar to 770-1100 CE) and the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA:-950 -1250 CE). There is, however, limited paleoclimate data that provide reliable estimates of terrestrial thermal variability in southern Central America during this time. In this study, we present chironomid-based temperature reconstructions, developed from sediment cores from two lakes: (1) Lago Morrenas 3C, a high-elevation glacial lake located on the crest of the Atlantic slope of the Cordillera Talamanca, Costa Rica, and (2) Laguna Zoncho, a mid-elevation lake located on the Pacific slope in southern Costa Rica. Distinctive shifts in the chironomid assemblages occurred at both sites between similar to 610 and 1230 CE. These changes are inferred to reflect an similar to 600-year interval characterized by depressed mean annual temperatures at Lago Morrenas 3C and dry conditions and lake level decline at Laguna Zoncho. Taken together, the multi-proxy paleoclimate records from these two lakes, including stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) and charcoal data, suggest that middle elevations on the Pacific slope and high elevations on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica experienced sustained drought, and possible cooling coeval with the TCD-MCA interval. The timing of hydroclimate variability in these records provides support for the hypothesis that cooling and drought in the northern tropical Americas during the TCD and early MCA were linked to thermal changes in the tropical North Atlantic.

Highest percentages of mangrove pollen in pollen zone I (from \~ 6200 to 5400 cal. yr BP) suggest moister and warmer conditions than at present related with global rates of sea-level rise and northward position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), suppressing El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Drier conditions and decreasing rates of sea-level rise at \~ 5400-4500 cal. yr BP are evidenced in pollen zone II by the lowest percentages of mangrove pollen and highest presence of disturbance pollen. Recovery of mangroves and tropical forests occurred from \~ 4500 cal. yr BP, suggesting moister conditions. Agricultural activities are recorded around \~ 4900, 4700 and 2400 cal. yr BP, although human occupation was scarce in the mangrove area.

Results provide the first quantitative analysis from the region demonstrating that frequent fires have occurred in the closed canopy forests since at least the early Holocene ( \~ 9000 BP), prior to occupation by sedentary agriculturalists. Following the arrival of agriculture around 4600 BP, the system transitioned from climate controlled to anthropogenic control. During the Maya period, changes in fire regime are muted and do not appear to be driven by changes in climate conditions. Low charcoal influx and fire frequency in the Earliest Preclassic period suggest that land use strategies may have included intensive agriculture much earlier than previously thought.

"A high-resolution sedimentary charcoal- and geochemistry-based reconstruction of late Holocene fire regimes in the páramo of Chirripó National Park, Costa Rica"	Quaternary Research (United States)	10.1017/qua.2019.64	"Multiproxy analysis of two sediment cores recovered from lagos Morrenas 3C and Ditkebi, located in the páramo of Costa Rica's Chirripó National Park, was undertaken to develop multidecadal-scale reconstructions of late Holocene fire regimes for the region. Analysis of macroscopic charcoal and sediment geochemistry (C%, N%, δ13C, δ15N, and C/N ratios) documents periodic burning of the páramo in Chirripó National Park during the past ∼1700 yr. The charcoal records provide evidence of high fire frequency between AD ∼560 and 720 and between AD ∼980 and 1230. Severe fire episodes are reflected by a rapid increase in the flux of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from the surrounding catchment because of the volatilization of páramo vegetation.
