Irregular, continuous canopy broadleaf management is a form of selective logging, very recently adopted in UK that produces woodlands with open canopies and substantial mid- and understorey growth. We examined spring and late winter bird densities, estimated using distance sampling, at 310 points in irregular, transitional (that being managed towards irregular), limited intervention, and coppice stands within a large working broad-leaf woodland in lowland southern Britain. Almost all understorey and canopy vegetation measures differed significantly across stand types. Ten of 20 species had highest spring abundance in irregular woodland, five in coppice, three in transitional, and just two in limited intervention. In winter, 5â€“6 species preferred each of limited intervention, irregular and transitional, while no species preferred coppice. Densities differed little across seasons except in Paridae where abundances increased in late winter during which limited intervention stands were used more by this group. Birds generally occupied similar niche positions and had similar niche breadths across seasons. Compared to under-managed woodlands, irregular silviculture in UK's Broadleaf woodlands is likely to enhance habitat quality for woodland birds, including several species of conservation concern e.g. marsh tit Poecile palustris which was twice as abundant in irregular stands as in any other stand type.

Lack of woodland management is known to contribute to declines in some taxonomic groups, for example birds. However, the response of bats to changes in woodland structure are poorly understood. We compared two measures of bat activity, derived from static acoustic recorders across 120 sample plots in coppice, irregular high forest (uneven-aged, continuous cover) and limited intervention (under-managed, even-aged) management stands, within a large tract of ancient woodland in southern England. Bat species richness was highest in irregular high forest stands, and there were significant differences in occupancy rates for most bat species across stand management types. Coppice recorded low activity of several bat species and irregular high forest showed high occupancy rates, including for Barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus, which is IUCN listed as near threatened. The occupancy rates in stand management types differed for some bat species between mid- and late summer counts, suggesting seasonal variation in habitat use. Within stands, most bat species were associated with opened canopy, lower growing stocks and reduced densities of understorey, and to a lesser extent, with large-girthed trees and presence of deadwood snags. In some cases, species responded to a given habitat variable similarly across the three stand management types, whereas in others, the response differed among stand management types. For example, increased numbers of large-girthed trees benefitted a number of bat species within coppice where these were least common, but not in irregular stands. Irregular silviculture high forest appears to provide many of the structural attributes that positively influence occupancy of several woodland bat species, including Barbastella barbastellus.

The results varied between study areas, but some bird species and some vegetation types differed in abundance with distance from the forest edge in some study areas. When the effects of vegetation differences were statistically removed, there were no major effects of forest proximity on the numbers of curlew, red grouse, dunlin and golden plover (the four most numerous species).

Journal of Applied Ecology	10.1111/j.1365-2664.2004.00875.x		The capercaillie Tetrao urogallus is widely valued as a game bird and an indicator of forest ecosystem quality. In Scotland, its numbers have declined since the 1970s, due primarily to poor breeding success. We investigated whether differences in breeding success among forests are related to predator abundance or to aspects of forest structure, with a view to identifying beneficial management practices. Capercaillie breeding success was estimated in 7-14 forest areas in Scotland each year during 1991-2001. Forest habitat, including ground vegetation, and indices of predator abundance were assessed in each of the 14 areas in 1995. Capercaillie breeding success increased with increasing bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus ground cover, but did not improve further above 15-20% cover. The main predators were carrion crow Corvus corone, fox Vulpes vulpes and raptors. Indices of their abundance were confounded such that their respective effects on capercaillie breeding success could not readily be distinguished. However, capercaillie breeding success was negatively related to a principal component score that represented the combined abundance of crows, foxes and, to a lesser extent, raptors. A management trial in one forest showed that capercaillie bred better when most crows and some foxes were killed than when they were not. An index of pine marten abundance was related neither to the other predator indices nor to capercaillie breeding success. Synthesis and applications. Capercaillie reared more young in forests with more bilberry and fewer predators. Management to improve the breeding success of capercaillie should aim for at least 15-20% bilberry ground cover, and legal control of crows and foxes.	41	1	59-71	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1991	120	Scotland	Findhorn;Grantown;Alford;Nethybridge;Abernethy;Carrbridge;Aviemore;Cairngorm;Aboyne;Ballater;Aberfeldy;Crieff;Perth;Auchterarder	57.65191655	-3.594325205	We investigated whether differences in breed- ing success between forests were related to habitat structure or to the species and abundance of predators.

In Scotland, its numbers have declined since the 1970s, due primarily to poor breeding success. We investigated whether differences in breeding success among forests are related to predator abundance or to aspects of forest structure, with a view to identifying beneficial management practices. Capercaillie breeding success was estimated in 7-14 forest areas in Scotland each year during 1991-2001. Forest habitat, including ground vegetation, and indices of predator abundance were assessed in each of the 14 areas in 1995. Capercaillie breeding success increased with increasing bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus ground cover, but did not improve further above 15-20% cover. The main predators were carrion crow Corvus corone, fox Vulpes vulpes and raptors. Indices of their abundance were confounded such that their respective effects on capercaillie breeding success could not readily be distinguished. However, capercaillie breeding success was negatively related to a principal component score that represented the combined abundance of crows, foxes and, to a lesser extent, raptors.

Journal of Applied Ecology	10.1111/j.1365-2664.2004.00875.x		The capercaillie Tetrao urogallus is widely valued as a game bird and an indicator of forest ecosystem quality. In Scotland, its numbers have declined since the 1970s, due primarily to poor breeding success. We investigated whether differences in breeding success among forests are related to predator abundance or to aspects of forest structure, with a view to identifying beneficial management practices. Capercaillie breeding success was estimated in 7-14 forest areas in Scotland each year during 1991-2001. Forest habitat, including ground vegetation, and indices of predator abundance were assessed in each of the 14 areas in 1995. Capercaillie breeding success increased with increasing bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus ground cover, but did not improve further above 15-20% cover. The main predators were carrion crow Corvus corone, fox Vulpes vulpes and raptors. Indices of their abundance were confounded such that their respective effects on capercaillie breeding success could not readily be distinguished. However, capercaillie breeding success was negatively related to a principal component score that represented the combined abundance of crows, foxes and, to a lesser extent, raptors. A management trial in one forest showed that capercaillie bred better when most crows and some foxes were killed than when they were not. An index of pine marten abundance was related neither to the other predator indices nor to capercaillie breeding success. Synthesis and applications. Capercaillie reared more young in forests with more bilberry and fewer predators. Management to improve the breeding success of capercaillie should aim for at least 15-20% bilberry ground cover, and legal control of crows and foxes.	41	1	59-71	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1991	120	Scotland	Findhorn;Grantown;Alford;Nethybridge;Abernethy;Carrbridge;Aviemore;Cairngorm;Aboyne;Ballater;Aberfeldy;Crieff;Perth;Auchterarder	57.07638412	-2.780897189	We investigated whether differences in breed- ing success between forests were related to habitat structure or to the species and abundance of predators.

Capercaillie breeding success was estimated in 7-14 forest areas in Scotland each year during 1991-2001. Forest habitat, including ground vegetation, and indices of predator abundance were assessed in each of the 14 areas in 1995. Capercaillie breeding success increased with increasing bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus ground cover, but did not improve further above 15-20% cover. The main predators were carrion crow Corvus corone, fox Vulpes vulpes and raptors. Indices of their abundance were confounded such that their respective effects on capercaillie breeding success could not readily be distinguished. However, capercaillie breeding success was negatively related to a principal component score that represented the combined abundance of crows, foxes and, to a lesser extent, raptors. A management trial in one forest showed that capercaillie bred better when most crows and some foxes were killed than when they were not. An index of pine marten abundance was related neither to the other predator indices nor to capercaillie breeding success. Synthesis and applications. Capercaillie reared more young in forests with more bilberry and fewer predators. Management to improve the breeding success of capercaillie should aim for at least 15-20% bilberry ground cover, and legal control of crows and foxes.	41	1	59-71	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1991	120	Scotland	Findhorn;Grantown;Alford;Nethybridge;Abernethy;Carrbridge;Aviemore;Cairngorm;Aboyne;Ballater;Aberfeldy;Crieff;Perth;Auchterarder	56.30045535	-3.702375192	We investigated whether differences in breed- ing success between forests were related to habitat structure or to the species and abundance of predators.

Annual breeding success from 26 Scottish forests surveyed between 1991 and 2009 averaged only 0.6 chicks per female, the lowest rate recorded in 16 previous studies. Reduced breeding success was due to proportionally fewer females rearing chicks rather than a reduction in brood size. Birds bred less well in Perthshire at the southern edge of the range, where declines in indices of female and male density were highest. Only at the core of the range (Strathspey), where birds bred better, were female densities stable. Two weather variables, April temperature in the pre-breeding period (APRTEMP), and temperature at chick hatch in June (HATCHTEMP), increased over the study period. Indices of Pine Marten Martes martes increased 3.9-fold since 1995, and those of Red Fox Vulpes vulpes by 2.2-fold, whereas those of Carrion Crow Corvus corone, raptors and forest floor vegetation showed no change. Neither forest type nor forest ground vegetation appeared to influence breeding success. Instead, females reared more chicks in years when hatch time in June was drier, and in forests with lower marten and crow indices. In addition, more females reared broods in years when Aprils were cooler. Brood size was unaffected by any of the measured variables. Densities of adult birds were lower in forests with higher fox indices. Increased predation of clutches and chicks by martens and crows within these small, fragmented forests, as well as changes in climate, may explain reductions in breeding success and hence contribute to continued declines. Successful conservation of Capercaillie in remaining Strathspey strongholds may require better predator management, including a licensed removal of martens to test the hypotheses that martens contribute to reduced breeding success. This short-medium term approach will inform longer-term predator management policies and complement aspirations to increase the area and connectivity of forest habitat to benefit Capercaillie in-part through mitigating against any impact of increasing forest-edge predators.	25	11	2171-2186	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1989	240	Scotland	Strathspey;Aberdeenshire;Perthshire;Moray;Easter Ross;Argyll	57.484011	-3.1684	The aim of the study is to investigate the factors contributing to low breeding success and population declines of re-introduced Capercaillie in Scotland, and to suggest possible conservation strategies to mitigate these declines.

Two weather variables, April temperature in the pre-breeding period (APRTEMP), and temperature at chick hatch in June (HATCHTEMP), increased over the study period. Indices of Pine Marten Martes martes increased 3.9-fold since 1995, and those of Red Fox Vulpes vulpes by 2.2-fold, whereas those of Carrion Crow Corvus corone, raptors and forest floor vegetation showed no change. Neither forest type nor forest ground vegetation appeared to influence breeding success. Instead, females reared more chicks in years when hatch time in June was drier, and in forests with lower marten and crow indices. In addition, more females reared broods in years when Aprils were cooler. Brood size was unaffected by any of the measured variables. Densities of adult birds were lower in forests with higher fox indices. Increased predation of clutches and chicks by martens and crows within these small, fragmented forests, as well as changes in climate, may explain reductions in breeding success and hence contribute to continued declines. Successful conservation of Capercaillie in remaining Strathspey strongholds may require better predator management, including a licensed removal of martens to test the hypotheses that martens contribute to reduced breeding success. This short-medium term approach will inform longer-term predator management policies and complement aspirations to increase the area and connectivity of forest habitat to benefit Capercaillie in-part through mitigating against any impact of increasing forest-edge predators.	25	11	2171-2186	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1989	240	Scotland	Strathspey;Aberdeenshire;Perthshire;Moray;Easter Ross;Argyll	56.396999	-3.437	The aim of the study is to investigate the factors contributing to low breeding success and population declines of re-introduced Capercaillie in Scotland, and to suggest possible conservation strategies to mitigate these declines.

Bamford_1985	Print	Journal Article		1985	Bamford, R.	Factors affecting the songbird communities of young conifer plantations.	Nature in Wales			A comparison was made of songbird communities in young Sitka spruce plantations on different sites in Mid Wales, viz. newly afforested sites, and sites replanted after clear-felling a previous conifer crop. Replanted sites have a more varied field and shrub layer, and support a differing bird population from that on newly afforested sites. Populations of breeding songbirds are expected to become similar on the two types of site as the stands become older.	4	1	82-87	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	1979	48	Wales	Dyfi Forest	52.607507	-3.911723	Compare a recent afforestation site with a recently restocked site (both sitka spruce) in terms of the birdlife found in each habitat	Pairwise comparison silviculture	Not reported	Not Reported	Sitka spruce	Not Reported	Single Age, Single Storey	Monoculture	Clear-cut	Mature;Mid-Rotation;Prethicket & Thicket	Not reported	Not applicable	Morphology	CBC Procedure	Yes	Yes	No	No	No	No	Canopy;Sub-canopy	Acanthis flammea;Accipiter nisus;Aegithalos caudatus;Alauda arvensis;Anas platyrhynchos;Anthus pratensis;Anthus trivialis;Asio flammeus;Buteo buteo;Carduelis carduelis;Certhia familiaris;Columba palumbus;Corvus corone;Cuculus canorus;Cyanistes caeruleus;Dendrocopos major;Emberiza citrinella;Erithacus rubecula;Falco tinnunculus;Fringilla coelebs;Garrulus glandarius;Lagopus lagopus;Locustella naevia;Loxia curvirostra;Parus major;Periparus ater;Phasianus colchicus;Phoenicurus phoenicurus;Phylloscopus collybita;Phylloscopus sibilatrix;Phylloscopus trochilus;Pica pica;Picus viridis;Poecile montanus;Prunella modularis;Pyrrhula pyrrhula;Regulus regulus;Saxicola rubetra;Scolopax rusticola;Sitta europaea;Spinus spinus;Sylvia atricapilla;Sylvia borin;Sylvia communis;Tetrao tetrix;Troglodytes troglodytes;Turdus merula;Turdus philomelos;Turdus viscivorus				The considerable difference in Wren numbers between plots can be explained by the poor Wren habitat of tall grasses and bracken found over Plot 1 (afforestation). Clear felled sites, even before restocking or much scrub invasion, are recolonised by Wrens which favour the piles of brash overgrown with bramble for nest sites and foraging. Meadow Pipit and Whinchat appear to prefer afforestation with tall grasses and heather whereas species such as Chiff-Chaff, Blackcap, Garden Warbler and Whitethroat either require mature forest surrounds or prefer the more varied field and shrub layer of restocked sites. Plot 2 (Restocked) made available nest sites for Willow Tit, Great Tit and Great Spotted Woodpecker. In addition, dead stems also provide ideal songposts for Tree Pipits well before the crop reaches suitable songpost height.	Birds	Partially	No	No	No

However, although international forest policy is increasingly advocating stands of mixed tree species, there is evidence to question the biodiversity benefits conferred by such forests. Using active ground-dwelling spiders and carabid beetles as biodiversity indicator taxa, we investigated the effect of forest stand composition on spider and carabid beetle community structure and composition. We conducted pitfall trapping in the summer of 2011 in 42 plantation forest stands across three different geographical regions in the UK and Ireland. Three common plantation forest stand types were examined: oak monocultures, Scots pine monocultures, and intimate Scots pine and oak mixtures (oak â‰¤60% cover). Forest stand type had a weak effect on spider and beetle species richness, with no significant differences in mixed stands compared with monocultures. There were few differences in species composition between the stand types in each region and indicator species analysis found few species specifically affiliated with any of the forest stand types. Land use history is hypothesised to have contributed, at least in part, to the observed important regional differences in spider and beetle assemblages. Our results do not support the perception that intimate mixtures of dominant tree species benefit biodiversity in plantation forest stands. Further research is required to determine the optimum percentages and planting patterns required for mixtures of canopy tree species in order to support forest biodiversity.

Taxa- and habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity, or â€˜biodiversity indicatorsâ€™, are commonly used to convey information about the state of the biological community since they can be assessed relatively quickly and cheaply by non-experts. Direct measures of a component of biodiversity are also increasingly feasible using DNA metabarcoding; â€˜Next Generation Sequencingâ€™ has facilitated the rapid characterisation of combined multiple species samples by sequencing their DNA barcodes in parallel, simultaneously reducing the need for taxonomic expertise and the time and cost required to obtain biodiversity data across a wide range of taxonomic groups. We investigated whether biodiversity information obtained from DNA metabarcoding of mass-trapped arthropods and from a range of taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. carabid beetles, Vascular plants) provide: 1) similar estimates of alpha and beta diversity and 2) provide similar forest management related conclusions. We also explored how well habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. stand structure, volume of deadwood) predict observed biodiversity patterns. The study was conducted in Thetford Forest, UK within 15 forest plantation stands (5 Scots pine-oak mixtures, 4 Scots pine and 6 oak monocultures). Our results demonstrated a high level of congruence between the metabarcoding and taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity. The wider range of taxonomic groups identified using a metabarcoding approach offered the potential to identify taxa sensitive to the environmental variable that was being manipulated experimentally (i.e. the composition of forest stands). Most habitat-based measures of biodiversity failed to predict species assemblage differences between stands.

Taxa- and habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity, or â€˜biodiversity indicatorsâ€™, are commonly used to convey information about the state of the biological community since they can be assessed relatively quickly and cheaply by non-experts. Direct measures of a component of biodiversity are also increasingly feasible using DNA metabarcoding; â€˜Next Generation Sequencingâ€™ has facilitated the rapid characterisation of combined multiple species samples by sequencing their DNA barcodes in parallel, simultaneously reducing the need for taxonomic expertise and the time and cost required to obtain biodiversity data across a wide range of taxonomic groups. We investigated whether biodiversity information obtained from DNA metabarcoding of mass-trapped arthropods and from a range of taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. carabid beetles, Vascular plants) provide: 1) similar estimates of alpha and beta diversity and 2) provide similar forest management related conclusions. We also explored how well habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. stand structure, volume of deadwood) predict observed biodiversity patterns. The study was conducted in Thetford Forest, UK within 15 forest plantation stands (5 Scots pine-oak mixtures, 4 Scots pine and 6 oak monocultures). Our results demonstrated a high level of congruence between the metabarcoding and taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity. The wider range of taxonomic groups identified using a metabarcoding approach offered the potential to identify taxa sensitive to the environmental variable that was being manipulated experimentally (i.e. the composition of forest stands).

We examined carabid beetle communities within a network of open linear trackways embedded in a plantation forest, in a region where conservation interest focuses on heathland associated species. The relative importance of environmental characteristics such as width, orientation, age of surrounding plantations and vegetation height on species associated with grassland, heathland and sandy habitats (GHS species) was explored in 36 trackway elements. A total of 3554 individuals were collected of which 1465 were GHS specialists. Linear trackways supported important carabid beetle diversity including 17 GHS species of which six are nationally scarce within the UK. The age of adjacent plantations was the most important factor determining community composition of carabids with GHS species favouring trackways surrounded by younger plantations. For predicting number and abundance of GHS species within a subset of trackways surrounded by younger plantations, models incorporating sward height in verges showed the strongest relationships. But results were statistically significant only for predicting abundance of the dominant GHS species Harpalus rufipalpis, which favoured wider trackways with lower vegetation and greater cover of bare sand. Current conservation management using forage harvesting of trackways does not improve habitat quality for GHS carabids. Seemingly continuous network of linear linkages is interrupted by sections of less suitable habitat surrounded by older plantations. Conservation potential could be enhanced by widening of trackways and management by physical disturbance of soil and vegetation.

Density and species richness greatly exceeded previous findings on newly afforested ground. Significant associations between occurrences of individual bird species and habitat factors were shown. The habitat was simplified to 2 principal component axes, which were attributed to succession of the conifer habitat and a conifer-broadleaf gradient. Overall bird densities increased with succession and declined along the gradient from pure conifer to much broadleaf admixed with the crop. Species richness did not vary significantly along these axes. Areas adjoining thicket-stage conifer crops older than those studied held lower bird densities than centres of the plots. -from Authors	22	3	619-633	Yes	Managed	Stand	2	1971	120	Wales		53.07947238	-3.805985001	Aimed to explore the bird populations of the early stages after restocking on a much wider scale than hitherto attempted.

This study provided baseline information at a key locality (Abernethy Forest, 37 km(2)) in the central Highlands of Scotland and trialed a new method of surveying red wood ant density and stand type associations: a distance sampling line transect survey of nests. This method is efficient because it allows an observer to quickly survey a large area. either side of transect lines, without having to assume that all nests are detected. Instead, data collected on the distance of nests from the line are used to estimate probability of detection and the effective transect width, using the free software "Distance". Surveys took place in August and September 2003 along a total of 71.2 km of parallel, equally-spaced transects. One hundred and forty-four red wood ant nests were located, comprising 89 F. aquilonia (Yarrow, 1955) and 55 F. lugubris (Zetterstedt, 1838) nests. Estimated densities were 1.13 nests per hectare (95% CI 0.74-1.73) for F. aquilonia and 0.83 nests per hectare (95% CI 0.32-2.17) for F. lugubris. These translated to total estimated nest numbers of 4,200 (95% CI 2,700-6,400) and 3,100 (95% CI 1,200-8,100), respectively, for the whole forest. Indices of stand selection indicated that F. aquilonia had some positive association with old-growth and F. lugubris with younger stands (stem exclusion stage). No nests were found in areas that had been clear-felled, and ploughed and planted in the 1970s-1990s. The pattern of stand type association and hence distribution of F. aquilonia and F. lugubris may be due to the differing ability to disperse (F. lugubris is the faster disperser) and compete (F. aquilonia is competitively superior). We recommend using line transect sampling for extensive surveys of ants that construct nest mounds to estimate abundance and stand type association.	109	1	47-53	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	2003	1	Scotland	Abernethy Forest	57.25	-3.6666667	provide the first assessment of the numbers and distribution of nest mounds of red wood ants in Abernethy Forest,	Pairwise comparison silviculture	Not applicable 	17	Scots pine	Ancient woodland	Single Age, Single Storey	Monoculture;Mixed	Clear-cut	Mid-rotation;Prethicket & Thicket	Restocked	Bog;Forest plantation	Morphology	Each ant hill measured, 5 individuals taken and identified	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	No	Forest floor	Formica aquilonia;Formica lugubris				Indices of stand selection indicated that F. aquilonia had some positive association with old-growth and F. lugubris with younger stands (stem exclusion stage).

At the turn of the century Dormice were reported from all Welsh counties. In the three decades from 1940 they were known from only seven 1â€km squares; this rose to 26 squares in the 1970s after a Mammal Society survey. Dormice are currently (1990â€“93) known from 107 1â€km squares, only 0.5% of Wales, and are clearly rare. They have recently been â€˜rediscoveredâ€™ in North Wales and Glamorgan. However, despite an increase in recording effort, very few sites have been found in northern Wales, implying a decline in status, and relatively few in the west compared to the east. Large tracts of Dyfed and Powys, where there is some suitable habitat, seem to lack Dormice. More than half of known Dormouse sites are in the deciduous margins of conifer plantations (36%) or in oak Quercus spp. woods (22%), both likely to be poorâ€quality habitats. Population densities at three sites are within the range of those measured in England. Forty per cent of known sites had some protected status, but 53% of sites were considered threatened, due to clear felling during forestry operations or lack of coppice woodland management. Dormouse distribution in Wales, on the western edge of the species' distributional range, seems to be strongly restricted by habitat suitability and climate. Many populations are likely to be threatened by replanting of ancient woodland and subsequent management harmful to the Dormouse's needs. Only 11% of ancient woodlands in Wales are large (> 20 ha). Dormice may therefore often occur in small woods, where their survival is likely to depend critically on the maintenance of hedgerows between woods. A programme of practical conservation and research is proposed to safeguard Dormouse populations. Copyright Â© 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

An evaluation of thinning to improve habitat for capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus)	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.038	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890883199&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2013.11.038&partnerID=40&md5=1b986b458a9b9469dc7eb62a9a23bf6c	In Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests the composition of the ground flora can be affected by the amount of light reaching the forest floor, influencing the balance between the three common ericaceous shrubs bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and heather (Calluna vulgaris). A pinewood ground flora with more than 20% bilberry cover is considered good habitat for capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), a large forest grouse of considerable conservation interest throughout Europe. Old, semi-natural Scots pine woodland is considered its prime habitat in Scotland, although this is limited in area compared to twentieth century planted forests. Action to manipulate environmental conditions within Scots pine plantations by altering light levels to favour bilberry through thinning and felling could potentially increase greatly the area of available capercaillie habitat in Scotland. We implemented a five year study to look at bilberry response to variable intensity thinning in two Scots pine plantations, where thinning followed management guidance for capercaillie available at the time. Bilberry was present in both forests but a positive response to thinning was not universal; although at both sites bilberry cover increased significantly over five years with levels &gt;20% cover reached, this could only be attributed to the thinning treatment at one of the sites. A treatment of small patch clearfelling did not lead to losses in bilberry. Management guidance published after the trial had begun, identified the appropriate intensity of thinning for enhancing bilberry cover at our study sites, indicated by the relative increase of bilberry in the plots where the prescription had been followed. Although there was no significant treatment effect by year five, 42% average bilberry cover was reached at one site tested. However the format of this guidance, a range of stem density-tree height combinations, was difficult to apply using typical forest management data and we explore redefining the guidance as a post thinning stand basal area range. We suggest &gt;22 to &lt;31m2ha-1 basal area would be appropriate in Scots pine plantations established at normal spacing and subject to the commonest form of selective thinning regime. This range in basal area can be achieved without conflicting with management for timber production. Our results also support small patch clearfelling as a method of diversifying plantation age structure which is compatible with maintaining capercaillie brood habitat.

Introduced species are, world-wide, one of the most serious threats to biodiversity. Grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis are one of many introduced species to have threatened a native congener; they are thought to have replaced red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris throughout much of the UK as a result of competition. The rate of competitive replacement may be influenced by habitat composition, with some red squirrel populations persisting for prolonged periods in the presence of greys in predominantly coniferous forest. 2. Here the similarity of red and grey squirrels' pattern of habitat use was investigated in Craigvinean forest in Scotland, UK, a site that has experienced apparent coexistence for up to 30 years. Overlap was examined in several dimensions: spatial overlap of home ranges, dynamic association and niche overlap. Habitat selection was examined at three levels: selection of core home range areas, selection of tree species within the home range, and the characteristics of patches used intensively by each squirrel species in comparison with random locations within their home range. 3. Although there was overlap between red and grey squirrel ranges, there were clear differences in the macrohabitats utilized, with red squirrels selecting areas of Norway spruce Picea abies and grey squirrels selecting riparian corridors of mixed woodland for their home ranges. Within their home ranges, habitat selection by individual red and grey squirrels was similar, but again with reds selecting Norway spruce and greys selecting patches of mixed conifers and Broadleaf trees. As no habitat variables consistently affected the microdistribution of red and grey squirrels within blocks or 'stands' of trees, stands that were used were thought to constitute good and relatively homogeneous habitats for squirrels of either species. 4. There was no evidence to suggest that red and grey squirrels avoided using the same areas at the same time, and potential niche overlap was considerable (0.77). However, partitioning of habitats may have reduced competition between red and grey squirrels and hence have contributed to red squirrel persistence at this site. 5. This work (i) reinforces earlier proposals that forest management offers a promising tool to assist the conservation of red squirrels; (ii) raises the issue of determining the spatial scale at which coexistence operates; and (iii) offers an illustration of how the management of invasive species can be mediated through the manipulation of niche availability.	39	6	875-887	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	1996	48	Scotland	Craigvinean Forest	56.5606604	-3.616992801	The study of situations where red and grey squirrels apparently coexist may help to determine the characteristics of habitats where red squirrels could persist in the presence of greys.

The rate of competitive replacement may be influenced by habitat composition, with some red squirrel populations persisting for prolonged periods in the presence of greys in predominantly coniferous forest. 2. Here the similarity of red and grey squirrels' pattern of habitat use was investigated in Craigvinean forest in Scotland, UK, a site that has experienced apparent coexistence for up to 30 years. Overlap was examined in several dimensions: spatial overlap of home ranges, dynamic association and niche overlap. Habitat selection was examined at three levels: selection of core home range areas, selection of tree species within the home range, and the characteristics of patches used intensively by each squirrel species in comparison with random locations within their home range. 3. Although there was overlap between red and grey squirrel ranges, there were clear differences in the macrohabitats utilized, with red squirrels selecting areas of Norway spruce Picea abies and grey squirrels selecting riparian corridors of mixed woodland for their home ranges. Within their home ranges, habitat selection by individual red and grey squirrels was similar, but again with reds selecting Norway spruce and greys selecting patches of mixed conifers and Broadleaf trees. As no habitat variables consistently affected the microdistribution of red and grey squirrels within blocks or 'stands' of trees, stands that were used were thought to constitute good and relatively homogeneous habitats for squirrels of either species. 4. There was no evidence to suggest that red and grey squirrels avoided using the same areas at the same time, and potential niche overlap was considerable (0.77). However, partitioning of habitats may have reduced competition between red and grey squirrels and hence have contributed to red squirrel persistence at this site. 5. This work (i) reinforces earlier proposals that forest management offers a promising tool to assist the conservation of red squirrels; (ii) raises the issue of determining the spatial scale at which coexistence operates; and (iii) offers an illustration of how the management of invasive species can be mediated through the manipulation of niche availability.	39	6	875-887	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	1996	48	Scotland	Craigvinean Forest	56.5606604	-3.616992801	The study of situations where red and grey squirrels apparently coexist may help to determine the characteristics of habitats where red squirrels could persist in the presence of greys.

Aims To investigate whether changes in availability of young woodland could have driven population change, and trends in abundance and occupancy, of declining Tree Pipit and Lesser Redpoll populations in Britain. Methods Modelling approaches used annual population indices and woodland planting statistics. Abundance and occupancy change between two bird atlases were examined in relation to changes in woodland availability from two woodland inventories. Results English declines were strongly associated with decreases in young coniferous woodland availability and less strongly with increases in young Broadleaf woodland. Abundance was related to the area of young woodland in corresponding 10-km squares. Young woodland availability declined between forest inventories and species occupancy maintained in 10-km squares with more young woodland; however squares that showed retention or increases in occupancy showed higher reductions in woodland. Conclusion We suggest declining availability of young coniferous woodland contributed to Tree Pipit and Lesser Redpoll population trends in England. Although likely to be the case in Scotland and Wales, the lack of sufficient temporal data inhibited our ability to test this properly. This work suggests that woodland availability was not the primary driver of Tree Pipit or Lesser Redpoll population trends.

In East Anglia, the species is now largely restricted to heathland and, in particular, the conifer plantations established on light soils in these areas. Here I evaluate how Tree Pipits are influenced by the age of pine restock and the patchiness of habitat in Thetford Forest in the Breckland area of Norfolk and Suffolk, eastern England. Both the probability of occurrence and the densities of territory-holding Tree Pipits varied according to the age of coupes of restock - densities peaking in restock 1-6 years old - and were also significantly higher in coupes (a stand comprising one or more forest subcompartments planted in the same year, usually with the same tree crop) in the largest, most central forest block than in smaller, isolated blocks peripheral to this. Within coupes, the distribution and thus densities of Tree Pipits were limited by the availability of songposts. Few songflights finished on the ground or in flight and displaying birds only perched on restock once trees were at least 3 years old (0.8 m high) - thus, territories were only established away from bordering or retained mature trees once restock had reached this age. Pairing success was reduced among males with territories of less than 1 ha, as found in the highest densities in restock, but was unrelated to the proportion of songflights that individuals finished on perches. Thus, although the availability of songposts limited the distribution of the species, it did not appear to affect individual breeding success. The study highlights the importance of pine plantations for the species in lowland England, but also the benefits of large blocks of habitat and targeted forest management, for instance, the retention of mature trees in coupes of restock for Pipits to use as songposts.

Ibis	10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.00915.x	http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/loi/ibi	Aspects of the reproductive success of Tree Pipits Anthus trivialis were examined in relation to broad-scale habitat and nest-site selection in Thetford Forest, a coniferous plantation forest in eastern England. Three habitat classes were defined corresponding to previously reported densities of Tree Pipits: clearfell and recently planted stands (habitat class A: low density), stands 2-5 years old (B: high density) and stands 6 years or older (C: low density). The preference for 2-5-year-old stands indicated by higher densities was supported by the timing of territory settlement. Tree Pipits also showed distinct preferences for nest-site characteristics that were relatively consistent across habitat classes and throughout the breeding season. At the 'habitat scale', results were consistent with the predictions of the ideal despotic distribution model. First clutches were laid significantly earlier in the preferred habitat class B. Overall nesting success (i.e. the proportion of nests producing fledglings), but not clutch size, also varied between habitats, being greater in habitat classes B and C than in habitat class A. The variation in overall nesting success between habitats was primarily driven by low nest survival rates during the laying/incubation period in clearfell and recently planted stands. Nest survival rates during the nestling period were lower in the preferred 2-5-year-old (and older) stands and declined over the course of the study. Preferences for nest-site characteristics (at least for those that were measured) provided no apparent benefit to nest survival rates. Overall nesting success thus appeared to be determined at the habitat scale, perhaps because the broad differences in cover between habitats affected the likelihood of nest predation (the main cause of nest failure). It is suggested that the very low nesting success experienced by Tree Pipits in clearfell and new stands may be one factor in the species' relative avoidance of this habitat and preference for 2-5-year-old stands.	151	2	361-372	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	2000	84	England	Thetford Forest	52.45415941	0.6706166691	To examine whether Tree Pipits exhibit preferences for certain nest-site characterists and whether those same characteristics explain variation in nest survival rate.

Burton_2016	Digital	Journal Article		2016	Burton, VJ, Eggleton, P	Microhabitat heterogeneity enhances soil macrofauna and plant species diversity in an ash - Field Maple woodland	European Journal of Soil Biology	10.1016/j.ejsobi.2016.04.012		The high biodiversity of soil ecosystems is often attributed to their spatial heterogeneity at multiple scales, but studies on the small-scale spatial distribution of soil macrofauna are rare. This case study of an Ash - Field Maple woodland partially converted to conifer plantation investigates differences between species assemblages of soil and litter invertebrates, and plants, using multivariate ordination and indicator species analysis for eleven microhabitats. Microhabitats representing the main body of uniform litter were compared with more localised microhabitats including dead wood and areas of wet soil. Species accumulation curves suggest that for this site it is more efficient to sample from varied microhabitats of limited spatial scale rather than the broad habitat areas when generating a species inventory. For comparative work sampling the main body of uniform litter is more appropriate, given that microhabitats vary from woodland to woodland and would make standardisation problematic. Vegetation showed more distinctive microhabitat-specific species assemblages than soil and leaf litter invertebrates and was strongly associated with environmental variables. Microhabitats with distinct assemblages included dead wood habitats, which had a high proportion of saproxylic species; a highly disturbed microhabitat with distinct plant and soil species characteristic of ruderal habitats and seeps with earthworm species rarely sampled in standard soil biodiversity surveys. The leaf litter in the conifer plantation area was species poor and the biodiversity quantified was considerably enhanced by the sampling from the additional microhabitats - illustrating the importance of small-scale heterogeneity for increasing plant and soil macrofauna biodiversity at this site.

Tree planting decreased habitat availability for most beetles, but provided new habitat for forest species. The greatest abundance, species richness and diversity occurred in non-afforested sites. Site ordination demonstrated an upland group on acid soils and a lowland group on mineral soils, with wet and dry components; species ordination was similar. A central forest group was due to both forest species and original species being maintained. Similarly, classification separated closed-canopy forest sites with little ground vegetation from the remainder. Afforestation had increased habitat diversity by adding trees, rides and roads to the original habitats, but diversity per unit area had decreased. Forest managers should aim to increase staphylinid diversity 'by design', particularly by varying tree species and age class so as to develop greater biological and structural diversity. Habitat diversity could further beenhanced by conserving representative areas of former land use, such as farm fields, river banks and open moorland; active management might be necessary to sustain these. Staphylinid species are favoured by forest edge habitats, so would gain from the integration of small habitat units within plantations, resulting in a beneficial 'knock-on' effect by being food for birds and small mammals.

Tree planting decreased habitat availability for most beetles, but provided new habitat for forest species. The greatest abundance, species richness and diversity occurred in non-afforested sites. Site ordination demonstrated an upland group on acid soils and a lowland group on mineral soils, with wet and dry components; species ordination was similar. A central forest group was due to both forest species and original species being maintained. Similarly, classification separated closed-canopy forest sites with little ground vegetation from the remainder. Afforestation had increased habitat diversity by adding trees, rides and roads to the original habitats, but diversity per unit area had decreased. Forest managers should aim to increase staphylinid diversity 'by design', particularly by varying tree species and age class so as to develop greater biological and structural diversity. Habitat diversity could further beenhanced by conserving representative areas of former land use, such as farm fields, river banks and open moorland; active management might be necessary to sustain these. Staphylinid species are favoured by forest edge habitats, so would gain from the integration of small habitat units within plantations, resulting in a beneficial 'knock-on' effect by being food for birds and small mammals.

Carabid beetle communities as indicators of conservation potential in upland forests.	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/0378-1127(95)03620-2		A comparison was made between ground beetle (Carabidae) assemblages in coniferous plantations within the Kielder Forest or Hamsterley Forest, Durham, with those on unplanted grassland and moorland habitats nearby. Site types sampled were: 16 plots in mature conifer plantations (13 Picea sitchensis, 2 Larix kaempferi [L. leptolepis] and 1 Picea abies) with no ground flora; 6 plots in mature conifer plantations (5 Pinus sylvestris, 1 12-yr-old Picea sitchensis) with ground flora of grasses and woodland species such as bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus; 18 plots in clear-felled sites aged 1 to 4 years; 10 plots in deciduous or mixed forest; 16 plots in grassland (Nardus stricta, Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus effusus dominant species); 30 plots in heather (Calluna sp.)-dominated moorland with Sphagnum and Juncus sp. in wetter areas; and 10 plots in mires (the 9 within the Kielder Forest are collectively designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest). Results indicated that coniferous afforestation disrupted the characteristic ground beetle communities of these open upland habitats, and carabid species-richness was low in closed-canopy plantations. However, when all stages of the forestry cycle were considered, the forests as a whole were as species rich as the surrounding habitats. Unplanted areas within the forests contributed to this diversity, but the early successional stages after clear felling were also species rich. The clear-felled sites were not favourable habitats for the rarer species of open moorland and grassland and these species also showed reductions in open habitats within the forests when compared with the open habitats outside. It is concluded that although forests contain as many carabid species as the surrounding open habitats, many of these species only occur on clear-felled areas. There is also a reduction in the numbers of rare species, especially those characteristic of wetter habitats. Wet areas such as mires within the forest should be monitored and managed to prevent further drying out and fragmentation.	79	1	63-77	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1987	72	England	Kielder Forest;Hamsterley Forest	55.23074751	-2.627514393	We have investigated the effect of af- forestation on one component of the invertebrate fauna only, the ground beetles (Cambidae), but we suggest that this group can be used to reflect the way in which invertebrate communities respond as a whole to the afforestation of open habitats.

Conifers have a tendency to produce detrimental changes in the soil that suppress decomposition. It is also possible that clear-felling and the short plantation rotation (40-50 years), usual in Britain, will eventually cause nutrient depletion. Decomposition rates are important in determining the level of nutrients available, to both the crop and the soil invertebrate community, and this study has compared them at three stages during the plantation cycle. 2. Cotton cloth buried in the soil of open areas decomposed at twice the rate of cloth buried in the soil of closed canopy plantations. 3. The rate of decomposition in the soil layer 0-80 mm from the surface was 1-5 times that in the 81-160 mm layer. 4. In young plantations, the decomposition rate of cloth decreased with an increase in the age of the plantation. It is suggested that the decrease in decomposition rate with plantation age is associated with increased shading and a decrease in the amplitude of the diurnal temperature cycle. 5. Springtail (Collembola) densities were high in spring on an open area and decreased in summer. The opposite occurred in the closed canopy plantation. Drying on the exposed open area is suggested as the cause of the decreased summer densities. 6. On the site where Collembola densities were monitored, decomposition rates were higher in the upper soil layer of the closed canopy plantation than in an open area. It is probable that this was due to the upper layers on the exposed area drying, rather than to the high Collembola densities checking fungal decomposition. 7. The nutrient release that accompanies decomposition has potential importance for the rate of growth of the conifer crop. This preliminary study suggests that the decomposition rate is highest in the years immediately after felling, probably favouring the establishment of the next rotation. 8. This study has not detected suppression of decomposition on open or clear-felled areas in Hamsterley Forest (NZ0530), suggesting that present planting and harvesting methods are appropriate and should continue.

Comparison of breeding bird assemblages in conifer plantations managed by continuous cover forestry and clearfelling	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/j.foreco.2015.02.017	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923365807&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2015.02.017&partnerID=40&md5=47daedab7c2383be30188ade6024cf58	Continuous cover systems are increasingly advocated for stand management but the implications for biodiversity in European forests, and specifically in plantations of non-native trees, are poorly understood. Timed point counts were used to quantify differences in species richness and abundance of breeding birds supported by conifer plantations (with major Sitka spruce components) under two contrasting management systems in upland Britain: continuous cover forestry (CCF) and clearfelling with replanting (CFR). Each CCF study area was paired with a comparable CFR study area. Sample points within CCF areas were divided into areas with extensive regenerating understorey and areas with none; sample points within CFR study areas were placed within young thicket and pre-thicket stands (trees. <. 10 years old) and older stands (15-30 years old). Poisson GLMMs were used to identify differences in bird species richness and abundance between the four treatments testing the predictions: (a) CCF can support an enhanced assemblage of forest birds relative to CFR (including mature CFR); and (b) CFR can support a broader range of open habitat and shrubland species relative to CCF (including those with a regenerating understorey). Ranking forest types in descending order of species richness gave: CCF with shrub understorey. > CCF without shrubs. > young pre-thicket CFR. > mature CFR. Many 'mature forest birds' were more abundant, or recorded only, within CCF (e.g. blackcap, wood warbler, redstart and hawfinch). A small number of species associated with young-growth ('shrubland' and 'shrub-layer' species) were most abundant in pre-thicket CFR but a CCF understorey supported some species at densities approaching those found in pre-thicket CFR. Simulations of the effect of increasing the proportion of plantation under CCF indicated for example that a plantation managed exclusively as CCF could support as few as 53% of the willow warblers as one managed exclusively as CFR. A plantation managed exclusively as CCF could support as few as 70% of the lesser redpolls as one managed as CFR, but could support twice as many blackcaps. CCF could be of greater conservation value to many forest birds than CFR. However, CCF may not support such high densities of some species (e.g. dunnock, willow warbler and lesser redpoll) as those found in young growth stage CFR. Forest management that includes some young growth areas alongside CCF could prove to be a strategy that maximises the capacity of a forested landscape to support a greater diversity of bird species.

Comparison of breeding bird assemblages in conifer plantations managed by continuous cover forestry and clearfelling	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/j.foreco.2015.02.017	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923365807&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2015.02.017&partnerID=40&md5=47daedab7c2383be30188ade6024cf58	Continuous cover systems are increasingly advocated for stand management but the implications for biodiversity in European forests, and specifically in plantations of non-native trees, are poorly understood. Timed point counts were used to quantify differences in species richness and abundance of breeding birds supported by conifer plantations (with major Sitka spruce components) under two contrasting management systems in upland Britain: continuous cover forestry (CCF) and clearfelling with replanting (CFR). Each CCF study area was paired with a comparable CFR study area. Sample points within CCF areas were divided into areas with extensive regenerating understorey and areas with none; sample points within CFR study areas were placed within young thicket and pre-thicket stands (trees. <. 10 years old) and older stands (15-30 years old). Poisson GLMMs were used to identify differences in bird species richness and abundance between the four treatments testing the predictions: (a) CCF can support an enhanced assemblage of forest birds relative to CFR (including mature CFR); and (b) CFR can support a broader range of open habitat and shrubland species relative to CCF (including those with a regenerating understorey). Ranking forest types in descending order of species richness gave: CCF with shrub understorey. > CCF without shrubs. > young pre-thicket CFR. > mature CFR. Many 'mature forest birds' were more abundant, or recorded only, within CCF (e.g. blackcap, wood warbler, redstart and hawfinch). A small number of species associated with young-growth ('shrubland' and 'shrub-layer' species) were most abundant in pre-thicket CFR but a CCF understorey supported some species at densities approaching those found in pre-thicket CFR. Simulations of the effect of increasing the proportion of plantation under CCF indicated for example that a plantation managed exclusively as CCF could support as few as 53% of the willow warblers as one managed exclusively as CFR. A plantation managed exclusively as CCF could support as few as 70% of the lesser redpolls as one managed as CFR, but could support twice as many blackcaps. CCF could be of greater conservation value to many forest birds than CFR. However, CCF may not support such high densities of some species (e.g. dunnock, willow warbler and lesser redpoll) as those found in young growth stage CFR. Forest management that includes some young growth areas alongside CCF could prove to be a strategy that maximises the capacity of a forested landscape to support a greater diversity of bird species.

However, long term (>100Â years) influences of such silvicultural systems on biodiversity in managed forests are poorly understood. Timed point counts in Scots pine forests in Scotland were used to quantify associations between species richness, diversity and abundance of breeding birds and different forest structures provided by CCF. Managed forests with old growth features (some including particularly old pines and snags) were considered surrogates for long term CCF stands. A stand category with an understorey of young trees (understorey reinitiation) was the most species rich (other categories in descending order were old growth, commercially maturing stands with no regenerating understorey and exclusively pre canopy-closure young growth stage) but differences were small and marginally non-significant. Heterogeneity in canopy layer structure at a scale typical of many song bird territories (ca 1Â ha) and the occurrence of old growth features were associated with greater abundance in a number of individual bird species but many associations were species-specific. Knowledge of species-specific responses to forest structure can inform management for the benefit of species of conservation concern and other priority species but requires better understanding of optimal structural mosaics including frequencies of old trees and snags for those species and groups. Bird distributions can change in response to extrinsic factors within the expected long-term plans for CCF managed forests; the contribution of structural mosaics to the resilience of forests in supporting a changing avifauna deserves further attention.

Managed forests with old growth features (some including particularly old pines and snags) were considered surrogates for long term CCF stands. A stand category with an understorey of young trees (understorey reinitiation) was the most species rich (other categories in descending order were old growth, commercially maturing stands with no regenerating understorey and exclusively pre canopy-closure young growth stage) but differences were small and marginally non-significant. Heterogeneity in canopy layer structure at a scale typical of many song bird territories (ca 1Â ha) and the occurrence of old growth features were associated with greater abundance in a number of individual bird species but many associations were species-specific. Knowledge of species-specific responses to forest structure can inform management for the benefit of species of conservation concern and other priority species but requires better understanding of optimal structural mosaics including frequencies of old trees and snags for those species and groups. Bird distributions can change in response to extrinsic factors within the expected long-term plans for CCF managed forests; the contribution of structural mosaics to the resilience of forests in supporting a changing avifauna deserves further attention.

The effects of thinning management on bats and their insect prey in temperate Broadleaf woodland	Forest Ecology and Management			Trees, woods, forests and associated biodiversity are being affected by anthropogenic climate breakdown, and need management to maintain delivery of a wide range of ecosystem services. Wood harvested from sustainably managed woodlands can be used to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through carbon substitution, directly using biomass for bioenergy to replace fossil fuels or indirectly through the use of wood products instead of higher carbon footprint materials such as concrete and steel. However, it is also important to understand how managing woodlands to mitigate climate change affects biodiversity. We tested the hypotheses that thinning woodland benefits bats and their insect prey by measuring bat species/species group richness and activity, and insect species/species group richness and biomass in 27 pairs of managed and under-managed Broadleaf woodlands, and explored temporal responses to time since management. Sixteen woodland characteristics were measured to investigate how management affected woodlands, and to assess the relative importance of these characteristics to bats and their insect prey. Woodland thinning significantly reduced five woodland characteristics known to be important for woodland-dwelling bats. Standing dead trees were three times more abundant, and tree cavities five times more frequent in under-managed woodland compared with managed paired sites. Woodland thinning significantly increased bat richness and activity. Common and adaptable bat species, and those that forage along woodland edges (e.g. Pipistrellus pipistrellus), were positively affected by management, presumably exploiting less cluttered woodland interiors. Rarer bat species, and species that roost predominantly in trees (e.g. Barbastella barbastellus) were negatively affected by management, which reduced roosting opportunities. Overall bat activity and species richness were relatively low in woodland that had not been thinned for 30 years before increasing. Insect biomass peaked after 30 years of no thinning. We recommend minimum intervention management to conserve rare bat species in woodlands, although common and adaptable bat species may benefit from intermediate to heavy thinning. Sustainably thinned woodland could be greatly improved for all bats by retaining or mimicking habitat characteristics that are more representative of old growth woodland such as (i) standing dead trees, (ii) tree cavities, (iii) heterogeneous canopy architecture, and (iv) an overall uncluttered below-canopy vegetation with pockets of densely cluttered shrubs.	457		117682	No	Not applicable 	Forest	1	2014	36	England;Wales		NA		Here we test the prediction that sustainable woodland thinning increases the richness and activity of bats and their insect prey when compared with under-managed (minimum intervention management, management prohibited and abandonment) woodlands.

Despite previous surveys of the bird's range in Scotland, there was no assessment of numbers giving confidence limits. Here we establish such a baseline against which future estimates may be set. Numbers were estimated from a combination of questionnaires, Geographical Information System (GIS) and advanced line transect techniques, using repeatable methodology which should be applicable to other cryptic forest species. The GIS was used to map capercaillie distribution and relative abundance in Scotland. Transects were then placed randomly within the bird's reported range, stratified by geographical region and estimated abundance rating. From observations on 426 2-km line transects in winters 1992-1993 and 1993-1994, the population was estimated to be 2200 birds (1500-3200, 95% C.L.) There were approximately twice as many females as males in the sample. Birds were present from the Forth-Clyde industrial belt northwards to the Dornoch Firth and from the Central Highlands eastwards. The main centres of population were in eastern and central Scotland (Deeside, Speyside and Perthshire). The highest densities were in native pinewoods (2.7-5.0 birds km-2), and the lowest were in thicket and pole/high canopy plantations (0.4-0.9 birds km-2). This information is being used to identify sites for enhancing capercaillie habitat under the Forestry Authority's Woodland Grant Scheme.	85	3	257-267	Yes	Likely Managed	Landscape	1	1992	24	Scotland		NA		To map capercaillie distribution and relative abundance in Scotland.

Aims: To determine the population size and distribution of Nightjars in the UK and examine associations with forestry and heathland habitat features. Methods: A volunteer survey was supported by professional cover in remote parts of Wales, and areas of Dorset and lowland Scotland. Two visits to allocated 1-km squares were made between late May and mid-July. Each surveyor recorded the locations of calling males onto maps and the occurrence of habitat categories within 50 m of each Nightjar registration. Results: Observers surveyed 3264 1-km squares in 2004 and, on average, 78% of the target habitat (90% in southern England). The total number of males counted was 4131 (range 3850-4414), adjusted to 4606 (95% CL Â± 913) to account for unsurveyed habitat. The adjusted total represented a 36% increase in 12 years. Nightjars were recorded in 275 10-km squares in 2004, a 2.6% increase since 1992. However, there was evidence of population decline and range contractions in northwest Britain, including north Wales, northwest England and in Scotland, in 2004, 57% of Nightjars were associated with forest plantations (similar to 1992) and 59% with heathland (slightly higher than in 1992). Conclusion: National objectives for Nightjar conservation (UK Biodiversity Action Plan: UKBAP) were reached in respect of population size and stability, but the target for a 5% range increase by 2003 was not met. The continued increase in the national population is probably attributable to habitat protection, management and restoration of heathlands, and the continued availability of clear-fell/young plantations in conifer forests. Management and/or protection/restoration/re-creation of these key habitats remains critical for the long-term objectives of UKBAP.

A high density of ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) was recorded in sample plots. Most individuals had regenerated prior to first rotation harvesting. There were large numbers of birch (Betula pubescens), most of which had regenerated after harvesting. Five non-native (introduced), broadleaf tree species and three non-native conifer tree species had also regenerated. The abundance of ground flora species typical of Irish Broadleaf woodlands declined with time from first rotation felling. The causes were the clear-fell process and tree crop canopy development with time. Second rotation plantation restructuring was also involved. During this process, dense-canopy spruce (Picea spp.) was planted on sites formerly occupied by the open-canopy conifer species, larch (Larix spp.) or pine (Pinus spp.) and Broadleaf woodland trees were planted on sites formerly occupied by spruce. We conclude that silvicultural alternatives to clear-fell, such as continuous tree cover are feasible but that they will facilitate the establishment of woodland tree communities new to biogeographically isolated Ireland. Maintaining the continuity of open-canopy tree crops on sites with an established Broadleaf woodland ground flora species is key for retaining the biodiversity gains of first rotation. We highlight the importance of strategic forest planning decisions in achieving this. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment	10.1016/0167-8809(88)90120-X		Carabid species assemblages were studied during 1984 in forest sites, representing a sequence of stages in a typical rotation of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), in Northern Ireland. The abundance of some species present on open moorland was diminished on forested sites, while others became more prolific as canopy closure advanced. At this stage a few species dominated the community. The different forest ages showed distinctions between their communities. Thinning the crop or the lower canopy had a marked effect on the carabid community, probably through the effect on humidity.	24	4	407-415	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	1984	2	Northern Ireland	Springwell Forest, Londonderry	55.06126	-6.7871601	This paper describes changes in carabid species assemblages which occur when an upland area is afforested with Sitka spruce, by studies on forest plots which are representative of progressive ages in a full forest rotation.

Associations between forest type and invertebrates: ground beetle community patterns in a natural oakwood and juxtaposed conifer plantations.	Forestry (Oxford)	10.1093/forestry/66.1.37		Ground beetles (Carabidae) were sampled in summer 1989 representative sites in Breen Wood, Co. Antrim, UK, a 21-ha Broadleaf woodland dominated by oak (Quercus petraea and Q. robur; many >200 yr old) and in adjoining 30-40-yr-old Picea sitchensis, Larix kaempferi [L. leptolepis] and Picea abies plantations on climatic blanket peat. The carabid communities in the two forest types were distinct from each other. Distinctions arose from the differential abundance of species and lower species diversity in the natural oak woodland. Species at sample sites in the oak woodland occurred with at least equal frequency at sites in the conifer plantations. The relatively species-rich communities of ground beetles in areas afforested with conifers may have been derived partly from upland blanket peat and heath, and partly from older woodland. At the transition zone between the two main woodland types there was an abrupt change in community character, but none of the changes in species abundance could be interpreted as being detrimental to the quality of carabid fauna in oak woodland.	66	1	37-50	No	Not applicable 	Stand	2	1989	2	Northern Ireland	Breen Wood	55.14166561	-6.239294803	The purpose of this study is to investigate the patterns exhibited by ground beetle communities throughout the oak wood and in the adjacent conifer forest.

Antrim, UK, a 21-ha Broadleaf woodland dominated by oak (Quercus petraea and Q. robur; many >200 yr old) and in adjoining 30-40-yr-old Picea sitchensis, Larix kaempferi [L. leptolepis] and Picea abies plantations on climatic blanket peat. The carabid communities in the two forest types were distinct from each other. Distinctions arose from the differential abundance of species and lower species diversity in the natural oak woodland. Species at sample sites in the oak woodland occurred with at least equal frequency at sites in the conifer plantations. The relatively species-rich communities of ground beetles in areas afforested with conifers may have been derived partly from upland blanket peat and heath, and partly from older woodland. At the transition zone between the two main woodland types there was an abrupt change in community character, but none of the changes in species abundance could be interpreted as being detrimental to the quality of carabid fauna in oak woodland.	66	1	37-50	No	Not applicable 	Stand	2	1989	2	Northern Ireland	Breen Wood	55.14166561	-6.239294803	The purpose of this study is to investigate the patterns exhibited by ground beetle communities throughout the oak wood and in the adjacent conifer forest.

For many species, the impact of forest operations and the effectiveness of mitigation, such as pre-operational surveys, re-tention of trees with nests or the use of nest boxes, are unknown. This study aimed to assess the impact of forest operations and the utility of nest boxes as a conservation tool, using the Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) as study species. We carried out the first quantitative assessment of drey survey effectiveness and tested the predictions that (1) red squirrel drey use increases post-thinning (2) nest box use increases post-thinning when their availability may be critical; (3) nest box use increases over time due to habitation and (4) nest box characteristics and placement affect nest box use. Our results show that thinning has led to squirrels changing their nesting behaviour with increased drey use post forest operations. We conclude that drey surveys are inefficient due the dynamic nature of drey use by red squirrels and that although foresters can detect a small pro-portion of active dreys, it is impossible to assess whether dreys are in use. Furthermore, nest box use increased after forest operations and nest boxes placed at a lower position in the tree were pre-ferred. Our results suggested that red squirrels habituate to nest boxes over time as nest box use was higher during the second year after deployment. Overall, we propose that nest boxes can be a useful conservation tool to mitigate the impacts of forest operations and conclude that early deployment of nest boxes can contribute to red squirrel conservation by providing shelter for red squirrels after forest operations â€“ and potentially for juveniles during natal dispersal.

Changes in occurrence of basidiomycete fruit bodies during forest stand development: with specific reference to mycorrhizal species.	Transactions of the British Mycological Society			The occurrence of fruit bodies of mycorrhizal fungi under differently aged plantations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) on deep peat was examined. Broadly similar patterns of occurrence in relation to stand development were found in both spp., but with some shift in the dominance of Lactarius rufus to older stands in Sitka spruce. The fruit-body successions indicated were Laccaria/Paxillus-Lacta6rius-Cortinarius/Inocybe-Russula for pine and Laccaria/Paxillus-Inocybe-Cortinarius-Lactarius for spruce. Changes in the saprotrophic agaric flora were also noted. Patterns of association with tree spp., together with seasonality of occurrence, are discussed in relation to resource quality of the litter and possible climatic and edaphic site characteristics.	87	1	163-171	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	1983	24	England	Spadeadam Forest	55.07745153	-2.629616994	The fruit-body surveys reported here were conducted in order to identify successions of mycorrhizal fungi in commercial U.K. forest stands on a nutrient-poor soil and to compare patterns of occurrence between two tree species throughout the season.

Transactions of the British Mycological Society			The occurrence of fruit bodies of mycorrhizal fungi under differently aged plantations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) on deep peat was examined. Broadly similar patterns of occurrence in relation to stand development were found in both spp., but with some shift in the dominance of Lactarius rufus to older stands in Sitka spruce. The fruit-body successions indicated were Laccaria/Paxillus-Lacta6rius-Cortinarius/Inocybe-Russula for pine and Laccaria/Paxillus-Inocybe-Cortinarius-Lactarius for spruce. Changes in the saprotrophic agaric flora were also noted. Patterns of association with tree spp., together with seasonality of occurrence, are discussed in relation to resource quality of the litter and possible climatic and edaphic site characteristics.	87	1	163-171	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	1983	24	England	Spadeadam Forest	55.07745153	-2.629616994	The fruit-body surveys reported here were conducted in order to identify successions of mycorrhizal fungi in commercial U.K. forest stands on a nutrient-poor soil and to compare patterns of occurrence between two tree species throughout the season.

A total of 64 species of spider were trapped in Scots and lodgepole pine; 56 in Scots pine and 32 in Lodgepole pine. The most abundant spiders, both in Scots and Lodgepole pine, were Linyphiidae. Scots pine plots were floristically more diverse and structurally more complex than lodgepole pine plots. More species of spiders and harvestmen (midsummer only) were found at ground level in Scots pine than lodgepole pine plots. More species and a greater numbers of spiders were found in the canopy of Scots pine than in that of lodgepole pine. However, no differences in the abundance of harvestmen were found between the canopies of Scots and lodgepole pine.

Bird communities of broadleaved and coniferous woodland differed with respect to their species composition. The mean number of individual birds recorded increased linearly with woodland age and was not influenced by woodland type, stand size or the presence of grazing. Woodland age and type and the presence or absence of grazing all significantly influenced bird species richness and the proportions of the bird community made up by granivores, insectivores and omnivores. Broadleaved stands held more species than coniferous stands. Ungrazed stands held significantly more species, particularly seed-eating species, than grazed stands and this effect was independent of woodland type. Ordination was used to relate variation in tree species composition and stand structure to bird community composition. A larger number of species was associated with broadleaved stands and stands with abundant undergrowth than was associated with coniferous stands or stands with little undergrowth.

Each factor potentially affects the conservation value of woodland for birds. Relationships between these factors and the structure and composition of breeding bird communities were examined in 69 stands distributed across a range of plantations composed of predominantly native broadleaved and non-native coniferous trees in the Forest of Dean, western England, in 1992 and 1993. Each stand was classified as one of three high forest types: broadleaved, coniferous or mixed broadleaves and conifers. Stand size had no effect on bird communities. Species richness and overall bird abundance increased with forest age when all forest types were combined. Within stands of similar ages, there were no consistent differences in species richness or overall bird abundance between the three forest types or between grazed and ungrazed stands. However, bird communities in mixed stands were intermediate in their overall species composition to those in broadleaved and coniferous stands. Regression and gradient analyses (CCA and PCA) revealed that major gradients in the species composition of the bird communities were associated with stand age and with tree species composition. The proportion of individuals contributed by hole-nesting species was higher in broadleaved than coniferous stands and increased with stand age. The proportion of individuals contributed by migrants was higher in especially the early years, but also in the late years of the rotation. The proportion of migrants was higher in ungrazed than in grazed stands and increased with openness of the canopy and development of low vegetation. The diversity of stands in terms of tree sizes and tree species was positively correlated with both number of bird species and overall bird abundance. The relevance of these findings is discussed in relation to the integration of bird conservation into coniferous forestry, focusing particularly on the value of broadleaved stands and the effects on bird communities of stand structure and grazing pressure.	85	1	183-197	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1991	12	England	Foresst of Dean	51.80846125	-2.556716468	The work aimed to compare species richness and overall bird abundance between commercially managed broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest stands across the commercial rotation relate these to woodland type, habitat structure and grazing.

Within stands of similar ages, there were no consistent differences in species richness or overall bird abundance between the three forest types or between grazed and ungrazed stands. However, bird communities in mixed stands were intermediate in their overall species composition to those in broadleaved and coniferous stands. Regression and gradient analyses (CCA and PCA) revealed that major gradients in the species composition of the bird communities were associated with stand age and with tree species composition. The proportion of individuals contributed by hole-nesting species was higher in broadleaved than coniferous stands and increased with stand age. The proportion of individuals contributed by migrants was higher in especially the early years, but also in the late years of the rotation. The proportion of migrants was higher in ungrazed than in grazed stands and increased with openness of the canopy and development of low vegetation. The diversity of stands in terms of tree sizes and tree species was positively correlated with both number of bird species and overall bird abundance. The relevance of these findings is discussed in relation to the integration of bird conservation into coniferous forestry, focusing particularly on the value of broadleaved stands and the effects on bird communities of stand structure and grazing pressure.	85	1	183-197	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1991	12	England	Foresst of Dean	51.80846125	-2.556716468	The work aimed to compare species richness and overall bird abundance between commercially managed broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest stands across the commercial rotation relate these to woodland type, habitat structure and grazing.

Each factor potentially affects the conservation value of woodland for birds. Relationships between these factors and the structure and composition of breeding bird communities were examined in 69 stands distributed across a range of plantations composed of predominantly native broadleaved and non-native coniferous trees in the Forest of Dean, western England, in 1992 and 1993. Each stand was classified as one of three high forest types: broadleaved, coniferous or mixed broadleaves and conifers. Stand size had no effect on bird communities. Species richness and overall bird abundance increased with forest age when all forest types were combined. Within stands of similar ages, there were no consistent differences in species richness or overall bird abundance between the three forest types or between grazed and ungrazed stands. However, bird communities in mixed stands were intermediate in their overall species composition to those in broadleaved and coniferous stands. Regression and gradient analyses (CCA and PCA) revealed that major gradients in the species composition of the bird communities were associated with stand age and with tree species composition. The proportion of individuals contributed by hole-nesting species was higher in broadleaved than coniferous stands and increased with stand age. The proportion of individuals contributed by migrants was higher in especially the early years, but also in the late years of the rotation. The proportion of migrants was higher in ungrazed than in grazed stands and increased with openness of the canopy and development of low vegetation. The diversity of stands in terms of tree sizes and tree species was positively correlated with both number of bird species and overall bird abundance. The relevance of these findings is discussed in relation to the integration of bird conservation into coniferous forestry, focusing particularly on the value of broadleaved stands and the effects on bird communities of stand structure and grazing pressure.	85	1	183-197	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1991	12	England	Foresst of Dean	51.80846125	-2.556716468	The work aimed to compare species richness and overall bird abundance between commercially managed broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest stands across the commercial rotation relate these to woodland type, habitat structure and grazing.

The selected plots included conifer plantations (up to 69 years old), Broadleaf plantations and the semi-natural Broadleaf edges that remain on parts of the perimeter of the site which were used as the control. A total of 13 682 seedlings emerged from the soil samples during the four-month germination trials. Fifty-two species were identified of which eight were ancient woodland indicator species for south-east England. The most abundant species represented in the seed banks were: Juncus effusus, Rubus fruticosus, Carex sylvatica, Betula pendula and Agrostis tenuis. Between-site comparisons of coniferous plots of different ages revealed a marked reduction in the seed species and seed density in plantations over 65 years old. Results of soil nutrient and texture analyses ruled out the likelihood of edaphic factors being responsible for between-site differences in seed bank composition. Seed species richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener diversity index) were greatest in the semi-natural Broadleaf edges, but the diversity index used also showed that two replanted conifer sites had high values despite few species being present. The usefulness and limitations of diversity indices in the context of seed bank studies is discussed. From the results of the study, management proposals for the site have been put forward in order to maintain floristic diversity and mitigate the impact of the proposed development.	6	10	1413-1428	No	Not applicable 	Forest	6	1995	4	England	Lyminge Forest, East Kent	51.153182	1.055713	This study set out to examine the seed bank composition associated with conifer plantations, chestnut coppice and semi-natural Broadleaf habitats at West Wood.

For this study, stands have been grouped into six types: Semi-natural broadleaved edge (native deciduous perimeter habitats with ancient woodland indicator species), replanted-conifer (0±10 years old. Open sites replanted since the hurricane of 1987 with trees at establishment stage), small-conifer (10±20 years old.

Dense plantations with little or no ground  ̄ora), large conifer (over 65 years. Fully mature ®rst-rotation trees with partial sunlight allowing ground  ̄ora) and other Broadleaf plantations (beech wood and sweet chestnut coppices) A random distribution of plots was established in order to include a range of topographies and soil types. Five samples, 10 cm deep and 7 cm diameter, were taken randomly from four 1m2 quadrats placed within the study plot. Quadrats were placed at equal intervals along a transect. The five cores from each quadrat were bulked together and agitated thoroughly. Large lumps were crumbled, removing stones and plant fragments. The samples were spread out into 35 X 21 X 5 cm seed trays giving a depth of soil of about 3.5 cm and randomly assigned to positions in a 7.5 X 1.4 m polythene tunnel. The soil samples were given a dressing of controlled release plant nutrients (ICI `Osmocote') at a rate of 40 g mA2, enabling seedlings to develop sufficiently for identification.

Mean estimated seed densities were greatest in the small-conifer and medium-conifer stand types. The large- conifer stands had the lowest seed densities compared with all other habitat types.Data from the replanted-conifer stands produced very similar diversity indices, greater than those of the other habitat types. The Shannon- Wiener diversity index for the large-conifer sites was high despite species poverty and low seed densities because the few species that were represented in the seed bank of this stand type had a relatively even distribution of abundances.

The selected plots included conifer plantations (up to 69 years old), Broadleaf plantations and the semi-natural Broadleaf edges that remain on parts of the perimeter of the site which were used as the control. A total of 13 682 seedlings emerged from the soil samples during the four-month germination trials. Fifty-two species were identified of which eight were ancient woodland indicator species for south-east England. The most abundant species represented in the seed banks were: Juncus effusus, Rubus fruticosus, Carex sylvatica, Betula pendula and Agrostis tenuis. Between-site comparisons of coniferous plots of different ages revealed a marked reduction in the seed species and seed density in plantations over 65 years old. Results of soil nutrient and texture analyses ruled out the likelihood of edaphic factors being responsible for between-site differences in seed bank composition. Seed species richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener diversity index) were greatest in the semi-natural Broadleaf edges, but the diversity index used also showed that two replanted conifer sites had high values despite few species being present. The usefulness and limitations of diversity indices in the context of seed bank studies is discussed.

In the UK's temperate uplands, large-scale reforestation is replacing long-established open â€˜moorlandâ€™ (heath, bog and grassland) supporting breeding bird communities of conservation importance. We quantified breeding bird species richness and abundance in 8â€“24 year-old native woodland plantations in Scotland and adjacent moorland and used bird densities to predict potential future abundance changes in woodland and moorland avian indicator species from recent national-level woodland creation policies. Bird species richness at point counts increased with increasing woodland cover, height and age and declined with increasing elevation. Differing abundances of bird species of conservation concern between woodland and moorland were related to their associations with vegetation measures, especially woodland cover and tree species composition. The creation of 54.9 km2 of native woodland in Scotland across 2017 and 2018 predicts reduced Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis (moorland indicator) abundance of 6214 individuals or 0.13% of current UK population, and increased Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus (indicator of young woodland) abundance of 6040 individuals or 0.13% of current UK population. Native woodland plantations comprised c34% of new woodland creation and the projections should be extended to other woodland types in particular non-native commercial conifer forestry. Native reforestation of open ground offers net gains in bird species richness but could disbenefit open-ground birds including those of conservation concern. Where retention of open-ground species is desired, landscape-scale reforestation should consider both woodland and open-ground wildlife.

Distribution and dynamics of surface-dwelling spiders across a pasture-plantation ecotone	Ecography	10.1111/j.1600-0587.1996.tb00152.x		The influence of the interface between different vegetation types on the surface active spider fauna within a grass pasture-coniferous plantation ecotone was sampled by pitfall trapping. Species abundance, richness and diversity relative to pitfall traps were measured along a transect across the ecotone. Spider species were classified into six categories based on their habitat preference and the influence of the non-preferred habitat. The number of individuals trapped progressively decreased from the pasture across the interface to the plantation habitat. Species richness increased by some 72% and diversity by some 141% at the interface. These increases were attributable to both the overlap of pasture and plantation species invading the non-preferred habitat across the interface, and to the presence of species with a preference for the ecotone.

Distribution and dynamics of surface-dwelling spiders across a pasture-plantation ecotone	Ecography	10.1111/j.1600-0587.1996.tb00152.x		The influence of the interface between different vegetation types on the surface active spider fauna within a grass pasture-coniferous plantation ecotone was sampled by pitfall trapping. Species abundance, richness and diversity relative to pitfall traps were measured along a transect across the ecotone. Spider species were classified into six categories based on their habitat preference and the influence of the non-preferred habitat. The number of individuals trapped progressively decreased from the pasture across the interface to the plantation habitat. Species richness increased by some 72% and diversity by some 141% at the interface.

Despite this, the ecology and phenology of this group is relatively understudied. This research determines carrion beetle assemblages in three macrohabitatsâ€”native Broadleaf woodland, non-native coniferous plantations and unforested sites of grassland or heathland. Further, it explores phenological changes over the growing season. Each macrohabitat type was replicated in eight geographical clusters, giving a total of 24 sites. Clusters were selected to give a wide geographical spread across Britain. Six pitfalls were set at each site, three baited with mice and three with cheese. Traps were set and collected fortnightly within every month from May to September 2016. The taxa differed in response to macrohabitat and growing season. Silphidae assemblages differed between forested and unforested habitats, whereas Leiodidae: Cholevinae were not distinguished by macrohabitat, although some specialists of forests were identified. Silphidae assemblages differed over the growing season, with May and June supporting a different suite of species to those in Julyâ€”September. In contrast, Leiodidae: Cholevinae assemblages changed very little over the growing season though some species did prefer particular time periods. Implications for insect conservation: This research presents the first large-scale study of the macrohabitat preference and phenology of carrion beetles in Western Europe, providing important ecological and phenological information which could aid in their conservation.

Despite this, the ecology and phenology of this group is relatively understudied. This research determines carrion beetle assemblages in three macrohabitatsâ€”native Broadleaf woodland, non-native coniferous plantations and unforested sites of grassland or heathland. Further, it explores phenological changes over the growing season. Each macrohabitat type was replicated in eight geographical clusters, giving a total of 24 sites. Clusters were selected to give a wide geographical spread across Britain. Six pitfalls were set at each site, three baited with mice and three with cheese. Traps were set and collected fortnightly within every month from May to September 2016. The taxa differed in response to macrohabitat and growing season. Silphidae assemblages differed between forested and unforested habitats, whereas Leiodidae: Cholevinae were not distinguished by macrohabitat, although some specialists of forests were identified. Silphidae assemblages differed over the growing season, with May and June supporting a different suite of species to those in Julyâ€”September. In contrast, Leiodidae: Cholevinae assemblages changed very little over the growing season though some species did prefer particular time periods.

We examined the role of the buried seedbank in vegetation development after clear-felling of stands within coniferous plantation forest in eastern England. The buried seedbank of 29 mature stands planted in the early to mid 20th century on lowland heathland and marginal arable was determined by germination of seeds from soil cores (30 bulked cores per stand). Seedbank density was highly variable, with a mean of 3950 (S.D. Â± 2400) seeds m-2. Ninety-eight species germinated, of which 37 were present in the surface vegetation of the mature stands; these 37 species had a higher density of seeds than the 61 species absent from the surface vegetation. Of those 61 species, 21 were recorded in the surface vegetation of recently replanted stands, suggesting that the seedbank may increase the plant diversity of replanted stands following clear-felling. The seedbank of mature stands was dominated by Urtica dioica and Holcus lanatus. Comparison of seeds in the top 20 cm of soil between four paired mature and replanted stands showed felling and cultivation prior to replanting had little effect on either the density of the buried seedbank or the vertical seed density profile. Twenty-nine of the species recorded in the buried seedbank of mature stands were characteristic of heathland assemblages of the region, but were present at low densities. Notably, a number of perennial grass species characteristic of heathland were absent, while Calluna vulgaris occurred in the seedbank of few stands and then at low density. The potential for grass-heath restoration following clear-felling of first rotation conifer stands investigated in this study is likely to be low. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study related the understorey plant species composition of a coniferous plantation forest in the UK managed by clear felling to environmental factors (stand structure, soil pH and previous land use) and ecological patterns (abundance-occupancy relationships, species dispersal and life history). Plant species richness and composition were recorded in 326 managed stands of different ages, soil types and land-use histories in a 185-km2 lowland forest planted onto heath and arable land. These stands planted with Pinus sylvestris or P. nigra were surveyed between 30 April and 15 July 2001. Stands replanted in the last 10 years had the greatest species richness, typically containing in the order of 18 plant species. Stands on soils of high pH had greater plant species richness, as did those on previously arable land. Less than a quarter (23%) of all species persisted in the above-ground vegetation throughout the growth cycle. The majority recolonized forest stands during the cycle, by physical dispersal or from the seed bank, largely after canopy opening in mature stands (26%) or after felling (47%). Annual species and species with plumed seeds were most abundant in early growth stages, while shrubs with berries were more abundant in mature stands. We found a strong positive interspecific relationship between frequency of stand occupancy and mean abundance within occupied stands. For species not persisting above-ground throughout the forestry cycle (i.e. patch colonizers), the slope of the abundance-occupancy relationship was steeper for those with a long-distance dispersal mechanism than for those lacking such a mechanism. Rotational clear felling of plantations may be an appropriate form of forest and conservation management in forests planted on former open areas such as heaths, where the conservation interest is not in old-growth species but in earlier successional species. Maximizing representation of young growth stages will help maximize plant diversity in such cases. These prescriptions contradict guidance for sustainable forestry; however, it is appropriate to vary guidelines according to land-use history and species composition. Our findings confirm the importance of dispersal to species persistence within landscapes comprising successional patch networks.	43	6	1160-1171	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	2001	4	England	Thetford Forest	52.45625781	0.6706393261	This study related understorey plant species composition and community dynamics to environmental and ecological factors in a clearfell conifer plantation forest in the UK.

However, there is a general paucity of distributional and abundance data for the species. In this study, we collated incidental records for common lizard sightings to define the distribution of the species in Northern Ireland. Maximum entropy modelling was employed to describe species-habitat associations. The resulting predicted landscape favourability was used to evaluate the current status of the species based on the distribution of its maximum potential range in relation to the degree of fragmentation of remaining suitable habitat. In common with previous studies in the Republic of Ireland, sightings were highly clustered indicating under-recording, observer bias, and fragmentation of suitable habitat. A total of 98 records were collated from 1905 to 2009. The species was recorded in 63 (ca. 34%) of 186 Ã— 10 km Northern Irish grid squares. Lizard occurrence was strongly and positively associated with landscapes dominated by heathland, bog and coastal habitats. The single best approximating model correctly classified the presence of lizards in 84.2% of cases. Upland heath, lowland raised bog and sand dune systems are all subject to Habitat Action Plans in Northern Ireland and are threatened by conversion to agriculture, afforestation, invasive species encroachment and infrastructural development. Consequently, remaining common lizard populations are likely to be small, isolated and highly fragmented. Establishment of an ecological network to preserve connectivity of remaining heath and bog will not only benefit remaining common lizard populations but biodiversity in general.

From May 1990 to June 1992, estimates were made of population sizes, survival (total and by weight classes), recruitment, and home-range sizes, usually at monthly intervals. In general, the population dynamics in a heterogeneous coniferous woodland were consistent with those described previously for this species in more homogeneous deciduous woodlands, suggesting that the same regulatory processes are operating in both habitats.	239	4	717-730	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1990	Not reported	England	Hamsterley Forest	54.65681045	-1.927591073	To characterize the pattern of annual fluctuations and population dynamics of A. sylvaticus 	Pairwise comparison chronosequence	Stratified	5	Sitka spruce	Not Reported	Single Age, Single Storey	Monoculture	Clear-cut	Mature;Prethicket & Thicket	Not reported	Not applicable	Morphology	Square trapping grids of 49 points (7 x 7) were used. with 15 m spacing between points, and a Longworth trap at each point. baited with a few grams of whole wheat and crushed oats.

The extent of ECM colonization of individual seedlings was 43.8-97.2%, with an overall mean of 80.3 +or- 1.1%. A total of 13 ECM morphotypes were differentiated, with 1-4 ECM types colonizing an individual seedling. ECM colonization was dominated by a single species, Tylospora fibrillosa, which accounted for 72.4-97.7% of the ECM colonisation recorded, on a plot mean basis. Other ECM types appeared to be distributed very patchily, only 2 types (Lactarius sp. and Mycelium radicis atrovirens) exceeding a mean of 10% colonization in any one plot. No significant correlations were recorded between ECM colonization and seedling growth, or between ECM colonization and soil pH, loss-on-ignition, or water content.	7	6	313-317	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	Not reported	Not reported	Scotland	Glentress Forest	55.66224415	-3.12537382	The aim of this investigation was to evaluate variation in the extent and composition of ECM colonisation of naturally regenerating seedlings of Sitka spruce [Picea sitchensis (Bong.)

White-faced darter (Leucorhinnia dubia) is a lowland peatbog specialist dragonfly which has experienced population declines in Great Britain. White-faced darter is thought to rely on peat-rich pool complexes within woodland, but this has not yet been empirically tested. We used dragonfly recording data collected by volunteers of the British Dragonfly Society from 2005 to 2018 to model habitat preference for white-faced darter using species distribution models across Great Britain and, with a more detailed landcover data set, specifically in the North of Scotland. Across the whole of Great Britain, our models used the proportion of coniferous forest within 1 km as the most important predictor of habitat suitability but were not able to predict all current populations in England. In the North of Scotland, our models were more successful and suggest that habitats characterised by native coniferous forest and areas with high potential evapotranspiration represent the most suitable habitat for white-faced darter. We recommend that future white-faced darter monitoring should be expanded to include areas currently poorly surveyed but with high suitability in the North of Scotland. Our results also suggest that white-faced darter management should concentrate on maintaining Sphagnum rich-pool complexes and the maintenance and restoration of native forests in which these pool complexes occur.	14	1	15-25	Yes	Managed	Landscape	3	2005	156	Scotland	Northern Scotland	NA		Here, we use MaxEnt models to investigate the habitat requirements of white-faced darter (Leucorrhinia dubia) and map its potential distribution in the whole of Great Britain with a particular focus on its main range in the North of Scotland using records collected by members of the British Dragonfly Society as presence points along with environmental data reflect- ing tree cover, climate and the presence of bogs.

In Scotland's Flow Country, a globally important peatland containing many forestry plantations, earlier studies found reduced densities of breeding waders on open bogs, when forestry plantations were present within 700 m. One plausible explanation for this pattern is mammalian predation. We tested whether mammalian predator indices, based on scats (feces), differed between (1) open bog, forestry plantations, and former plantations being restored as bog (â€œrestorationâ€ habitats); (2) restoration habitats of different ages; and (3) open bogs with differing amounts of nearby forestry. We measured summer scat density and size over 14 years in 26 transects 0.6â€“4.5 km in length, collecting data during 93, 96, and 79 transect-years in bog, forestry, and restoration habitats respectively. In forestry, scat density increased eightfold, reaching values ~6 times higher than those of bogs. On open bogs with over 10% forestry within 700 m, scat densities were 2.9 times higher than on open bogs with less forestry nearby. Results support the hypothesis that mammalian predators might be responsible for the low densities of breeding waders close to forests, on adjacent open bogs. In restoration habitats, scat densities rose 6â€“10 years after felling but fell to levels similar to open bogs in older restoration habitats, supporting restoration management as a means of reducing mammalian predator activity/abundance. We urge caution around decisions to establish forestry plantations in open landscapes of high biodiversity importance.

Current British guidelines for this restoration have rarely been examined, and this study is the first to test their value for natural regeneration. The survival and growth of naturally regenerating ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) seedlings was observed in thinned, selectively felled and clearfelled plots within a c. 40-year-old stand of Corsican pine (Pinus nigra Arnold ssp. laricio Maire). After felling in 2001, the ground flora in all treatments became dominated by bramble (Rubus fruticosus L. agg.) and its cover 5 years after felling was 75-95 % at a height of 0. 9-1. 2 m. During the study, seedling numbers declined 80-90 %. Although bramble had some adverse effects, seedling survival was unaffected by felling treatment. Seedling growth varied between treatments with those in the clearfell being tallest. Mean height of seedlings was always less than that of bramble, but by 2006 65 % of quadrats in the clearfelled plots had well-established individuals taller than the bramble compared with 35 % in the thinned plots. Models that described the relationships between seedling growth, basal area and bramble were complex, but results clearly indicate that maintaining canopy cover during restoration is probably an ineffective method of suppressing bramble on sites where it grows well. Results do not support the current British advice on conversion, but this may reflect the characteristics of pine canopies and the maintenance of canopy cover during conversion may be appropriate in stands of species, which cast more shade.

To assess habitat associations of 28 woodland species, a large-scale study was carried out across Great Britain. A total of 2668 stands embedded in 825 woodland sites were surveyed. The number of species recorded in each stand and the occurrence of each species was examined in relation to the unique (or marginal) effects of gross structural characteristics of stands (growth stage and understorey structure), plant species composition (floristics) expressed in terms of dominant tree, shrub layer and field layer species and both sets of variables considered together whilst controlling for the spatial distribution of sites and site identity. The number of species recorded was independently related to growth stage, understorey structure, tree composition and field layer type. Eighteen species showed at least one significant relationship in models containing structure variables only. Thirteen species showed at least one significant relationship in models containing floristic variables only. In models containing both structure and floristic variables; 14 species showed at least one significant relationship with a structure variable, 9 species with at least one floristic variable and 8 species with both at least one structure and at least one floristic variable. Different bird species showed individualistic patterns of association with habitat variables. Results suggest that structure and floristics have complex and inter-related effects on bird distribution across woodland stands. Some of the apparent relationships with structure were a consequence of between-stand differences in floristics and vice versa whilst in two cases relationships with structure variables became apparent after controlling for the masking effects of floristic variables. Both vegetation structure and floristics appear to be important determinants of composition in bird assemblages in British woodland, though gross structural factors have previously received most emphasis. The existence of species-specific responses to habitat variation suggests that habitat heterogeneity, embracing structure and floristics, should be a key element in conservation planning within forests especially in the light of uncertainty about future regional species pools due to climate change. We discuss how responses of birds to habitat variation at the level of stands can form a basis for developing large-scale conservation strategies within managed forests.

To assess habitat associations of 28 woodland species, a large-scale study was carried out across Great Britain. A total of 2668 stands embedded in 825 woodland sites were surveyed. The number of species recorded in each stand and the occurrence of each species was examined in relation to the unique (or marginal) effects of gross structural characteristics of stands (growth stage and understorey structure), plant species composition (floristics) expressed in terms of dominant tree, shrub layer and field layer species and both sets of variables considered together whilst controlling for the spatial distribution of sites and site identity. The number of species recorded was independently related to growth stage, understorey structure, tree composition and field layer type. Eighteen species showed at least one significant relationship in models containing structure variables only. Thirteen species showed at least one significant relationship in models containing floristic variables only. In models containing both structure and floristic variables; 14 species showed at least one significant relationship with a structure variable, 9 species with at least one floristic variable and 8 species with both at least one structure and at least one floristic variable. Different bird species showed individualistic patterns of association with habitat variables. Results suggest that structure and floristics have complex and inter-related effects on bird distribution across woodland stands. Some of the apparent relationships with structure were a consequence of between-stand differences in floristics and vice versa whilst in two cases relationships with structure variables became apparent after controlling for the masking effects of floristic variables. Both vegetation structure and floristics appear to be important determinants of composition in bird assemblages in British woodland, though gross structural factors have previously received most emphasis. The existence of species-specific responses to habitat variation suggests that habitat heterogeneity, embracing structure and floristics, should be a key element in conservation planning within forests especially in the light of uncertainty about future regional species pools due to climate change. We discuss how responses of birds to habitat variation at the level of stands can form a basis for developing large-scale conservation strategies within managed forests.

Ground vegetation in 1944 still resembled that of grazed heathland and was related to past land use. In 1976, the ground vegetation was similar to that of local Quercus petraea woodland, but was richer in bryophytes.

Ungrazed oak woodland had the highest counts of individual birds in both years. More species occurred in oak woods than in conifers. Ordination of the combined data from the 2 winters illustrated a consistent gradient of bird species composition (after the exclusion of 2 flocking species, Woodpigeon and Chaffinch), from evergreen coniferous to deciduous broadleaf. Green and Great-spotted Wood-pecker, Hawfinch, Fieldfare, Brambling, Great Tit, Magpie and Siskin occurred largely towards the deciduous broadleaf end of the gradient. Classification of the bird data split the sites firstly into deciduous broadleaf and evergreen coniferous.

Densities and population estimates of breeding Eurasian Woodcock Scolopax rusticola in Britain in 2003	Bird Study			Capsule The breeding Eurasian Woodcock population in Britain was estimated at 78 346 males (95% CL 61 717–96 493), with substantial differences in densities between regions and woodland type. Aim To estimate the breeding population size of Woodcock in Britain using a dedicated survey method, to enable assessment of current status and the creation of a baseline for future monitoring. Methods Passes of roding male Woodcock were recorded on three evening visits to 807 randomly selected sites, stratified by region and woodland size, by volunteer observers during May–June 2003. Results Roding Woodcock were present in 35% of 1-km squares containing at least 10 ha of woodland and the mean density of males in occupied squares was 2.76 ± 0.29 birds/km2 (± se). There was significant regional variation in the occurrence and density of roding Woodcock. Woodcock presence differed between woodland types at the 1-km 2 level and the stand level, but densities within occupied woods were similar across woodland types. Conclusion Previous estimates of the size of the British breeding Woodcock population are far too low and the species shows much spatial variation in breeding density.	56	1	15-25	Yes	Likely Managed	Stand	1	2003	2	England;Scotland;Wales		NA		We present the results of the first national survey of breeding Woodcock in Britain, the aim of which was to produce reliable baseline population estimates for England, Scotland and Wales against which future esti- mates could be compared.

Mountain hares (Lepus timidus L.) are summer grazers that switch to browse in winter, while rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) eat mostly grasses throughout the year. These different feeding strategies may underlie seasonal patterns of habitat selection by the two species. 2. In this study the habitat utilization by adult female mountain hares and adult female rabbits was studied by radio-tracking in a habitat composed of open moorland, upland pasture and young forestry plantation with an abundant ground flora.

The range size of adult female mountain hares (Lepus timidus L.) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.), occupying a landscape composed of moorland, young forest and upland pasture, were studied by radio-telemetry. The factors that affect range size of the two species were identified and interpreted with regard to their respective feeding strategies; mountain hares are summer grazers that browse in winter whereas rabbits cat grasses throughout the year. 2. Individual mountain hares were classified as 'moorland', 'forest' or 'pasture' hares, and individual rabbits were classified as 'forest', 'pasture' or 'mixture' rabbits according to the frequency with which they used each habitat. Home-range size of both species was highly variable with a mean area (and standard deviation) of 22.2 ha (SD = 18.5) for hares and 6.3 ha (SD = 3.9) for rabbits. 3. Home-range size of mountain hares varied according to habitat and season. There was a negative correlation between home-range size and the available green biomass of grass. This suggests that the large home ranges of 'moorland' hares during the breeding and post-breeding seasons may have been a consequence of low food availability. 4. Home-range size of rabbits also varied according to habitat and season, but was not clearly associated with food availability, feeding strategy or social behaviour. 5. In the early years following planting, extensive afforestation of upland moorlands is unlikely to affect mountain hare and rabbit populations if an abundant ground flora is available. Individuals of both species may even remain entirely within the plantation using very small home-ranges. However, single age plantations would have to be restructured to increase the age diversity and hence the availability of suitable habitats for long-term maintenance of viable populations of mountain hares.	33	6	1479-1488	No	Not applicable 	Landscape	1	1989	10	Scotland	Glen Buchat	57.22098222	-2.999814678	To understand is successional changes in a landscape will affect the two herbivore species differently and the consequential implications for land use management	Pairwise comparison landuse	Stratified	Not Reported	Sitka spruce	Bog;Heathland;Pasture	Mixed Age, Mixed Storey;Single Age, Single Storey	Monoculture;Mixed	Clear-cut	Mature;Prethicket & Thicket	Not reported	Bog;Heathland;Pasture	Morphology	92 rabbits and 268 mountain hares caught and fitted with radiotrackers to assess range size from, 1990-91	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	Forest floor	Lepus timidus L.;Oryctolasgus cuniculus L.

The potential impact of such a change in land use on host-parasite interactions was investigated by comparing the intensity and prevalence of infection of hares by parasites in two separate habitats: a large hare-fenced young forestry plantation and the adjacent open moorland. Carcasses were collected in November 1990 from within both habitats and after the woodland had been enclosed for nine months. Age, sex, fatness (kidney fat index) and degree of infection of hares were noted. Two parasites were recorded: the nematode Trichostrongylus retortaeformis and the cestode Mosgovoyia pectinata. Clear differences in the intensity of infection of adults occupying the different habitats had occurred in the nine months since woodland enclosure. Adult mountain hares in the woodland had levels of infections approaching four times that observed in hares occupying the open moorland and although not significant, the prevalence of infection was greater in hosts inhabiting the woodland than the open moorland. It is suggested that the parasite-host relationship differs between the two habitats and as heather-dominated moorland landscapes become more fragmented with the increasing establishment of woodlands, the impact of parasites on the life history strategies of mountain hares needs to be reconsidered.	75	4	345-349	No	Not applicable 	Landscape	1	1990	1	Scotland	Cairngorm Mountains	57.07565334	-3.575030315	The potential impact of such a change in land use on host-parasite interactions was investigated by comparing the intensity and prevalence of infection of hares by parasites in two separate habitats: a large hare-fenced young forestry plantation and the adjacent open moorland.

Adult mountain hares in the woodland had levels of infections approaching four times that observed in hares occupying the open moorland and although not significant, the prevalence of infection was greater in hosts inhabiting the woodland than the open moorland. It is suggested that the parasite-host relationship differs between the two habitats and as heather-dominated moorland landscapes become more fragmented with the increasing establishment of woodlands, the impact of parasites on the life history strategies of mountain hares needs to be reconsidered.	75	4	345-349	No	Not applicable 	Landscape	1	1990	1	Scotland	Cairngorm Mountains	57.07565334	-3.575030315	The potential impact of such a change in land use on host-parasite interactions was investigated by comparing the intensity and prevalence of infection of hares by parasites in two separate habitats: a large hare-fenced young forestry plantation and the adjacent open moorland.

Botanical Journal of Scotland			A six-year experiment in the Millbuie Forest near Inverness, Scotland, assessed the effects of crop thinning, fencing, and ground preparation (screefing) on the development of understorey vegetation in a first rotation Pinus sylvestris plantation. Thinning or fencing had no effect on species richness or diversity, but richness increased to a greater degree in screefed plots than in unscreefed controls. Fencing benefited the establishment of Goodyera repens colonies. Vegetation was matched against the National Vegetation Classification W18a community (Pinus sylvestris-Hylocomium splendens woodland: Erica cinerea-Goodyera repens sub-community).

Our study investigated the use of different aged conifer plantations by reptiles in southern England using arrays of artificial refuges, placed within 20 plantations of varying age, to determine the presence of reptiles annually within each between 2009 and 2013. All six native British reptile species (adder Vipera berus, grass snake Natrix natrix, smooth snake Coronella austriaca, common lizard Zootoca vivipara, sand lizard Lacerta agilis, slow worm Anguis fragilis) occurred in conifer plantations. Excluding the slow worm, which occurred in plantations of all ages, the majority of reptile observations occurred in plantations up to 20 years old and where tree canopy cover was below 65% with the highest numbers occurring in 3-12 year old plantations with a canopy cover below 50%. The early stages of plantation growth are utilised well by reptiles but become increasingly unsuitable over time. Furthermore, the availability of suitable reptile habitat is transient, depending on the rate of tree growth, the timing and extent of tree thinning and felling operations, the size of the plantation units and their proximity to adjacent areas inhabited by reptiles. Our study shows that coniferous forests can be managed so that both timber production and biodiversity conservation can be achieved through the formation of a mosaic of relatively small, multi-aged plantations and that small changes in ground preparation and habitat management practices may further enhance its suitability for reptiles and, by implication, for species from other taxa. The results of our study also have pertinence for species conservation and biodiversity within similar managed forestry throughout the world.

However, there is currently little knowledge of the extent to which the soil microbial communities associated with past vegetation persist in such systems. This study used fungal-specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA environmental clone libraries to compare fungal communities in fourancient semi-naturalwoodland sites in theUKwith adjacent non-native conifer plantations, and with adjacent grassland. In total,we recovered 190 distinct ITS sequence types (ITS types), of which the greatest diversity occurred in ancient semi-natural woodland. Although ancient semi-natural woodland and adjacent conifer plantations shared 27 ITS types, none were shared between woodland and grassland sites. A total of 16 ectomycorrhizal generawere subsequently identified using BLASTn searches, of which ninewere recovered fromboth woodland types and nonewere shared between woodland and grassland sites. Only eight of these generahadpreviously beenidentified fromsporophores during50years of surveying carried out at thesamewoodland sites. We conclude that fungal communities associated with ancient semi-natural woodland also exist on sites converted to non-native conifer plantations. In consequence, attempts to restore native, semi-natural woodland may have an increased chance of success when focussed on restoration of plantations, rather than the creation of new woodland on ex-agricultural land.

This study used fungal-specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA environmental clone libraries to compare fungal communities in fourancient semi-naturalwoodland sites in theUKwith adjacent non-native conifer plantations, and with adjacent grassland. In total,we recovered 190 distinct ITS sequence types (ITS types), of which the greatest diversity occurred in ancient semi-natural woodland. Although ancient semi-natural woodland and adjacent conifer plantations shared 27 ITS types, none were shared between woodland and grassland sites. A total of 16 ectomycorrhizal generawere subsequently identified using BLASTn searches, of which ninewere recovered fromboth woodland types and nonewere shared between woodland and grassland sites. Only eight of these generahadpreviously beenidentified fromsporophores during50years of surveying carried out at thesamewoodland sites. We conclude that fungal communities associated with ancient semi-natural woodland also exist on sites converted to non-native conifer plantations. In consequence, attempts to restore native, semi-natural woodland may have an increased chance of success when focussed on restoration of plantations, rather than the creation of new woodland on ex-agricultural land.

Coppice-with-standards stands were clear-felled during the Second World War and replanted with conifer/conifer-broadleaved mixtures in which the conifer was dominant. Since 1985 broadleaves have been favoured. In 1983, the ground flora had been recorded in six plantation stands of different tree species and compared with three remnant broadleaved stands. Five 200 m2 quadrats were taken spread across each stand. The survey was repeated using the same methods in 2015 to assess changes. In addition, in 2015, single 200 m2 quadrats were taken in 21 other stands to put the re-recorded stands into a wider site context. In the nine re-recorded stands, six stands lost species (mean number of species per quadrat) between 1983 and 2015, only three stands gained them. Increases in species richness were associated with management (felling or thinning) or where stands had opened out through wind-throw. Species with higher Ellenberg light scores showed higher turnover than more shade-tolerant species. In stands recorded only in 2015 oak Quercus robur stands derived from formerly conifer-dominant crops, showed a similar richness and species profile to the remnant broadleaved stands. Specialist woodland plants did not appear to be adversely affected by this active management of the stands. The results indicate that in terms of the ground flora at this site the 1985 Broadleaves Policy achieved one of its aims of maintaining/restoring the special character of ancient woodland.

Although most remaining forest cover in Europe consists of intensively managed plantation woodlands, no studies have examined the influence of management practices on moth communities within plantations. Here, we aimed to determine: (1) how species richness, abundance, diversity of macro and micro moths in commercial conifer plantations respond to management at multiple spatial scales; (2) what the impacts of forest management practices on moth diversity are, and (3) how priority Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species respond to management. BAP species were selected as they represent formerly widespread and common species, which have undergone substantial declines in the UK and Europe. We assessed moth communities in three conifer plantations in Northern England and Scotland by light trapping, combining local (e.g. age of planting) and landscape level (e.g. proximity to felled areas) characteristics to evaluate the impacts of forest management on moths. We found no relationship between local factors and moth richness, abundance and diversity but the amount of clear felling in the surrounding landscape had a strongly negative correlation. In contrast, the amount and proximity of broadleaf cover in the surrounding landscape positively influenced macro moth richness and abundance. For six BAP species, abundances were lower close to felled areas but increased with the size of adjacent broadleaf patches. We conclude that clear felling negatively affects moths, probably through alteration of habitats, the loss of larval host plants, and by limiting dispersal. A shift to continuous cover and maintaining broadleaf tree cover within plantations will greatly enhance their value for moth communities.

Negative impacts of felling in exotic spruce plantations on moth diversity mitigated by remnants of deciduous tree cover	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/j.foreco.2017.09.010	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029184771&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2017.09.010&partnerID=40&md5=b495f6da1574d784c5ca881e1acbdbe0	Moths are a vital ecosystem component and are currently undergoing extensive and severe declines across multiple species, partly attributed to habitat alteration. Although most remaining forest cover in Europe consists of intensively managed plantation woodlands, no studies have examined the influence of management practices on moth communities within plantations. Here, we aimed to determine: (1) how species richness, abundance, diversity of macro and micro moths in commercial conifer plantations respond to management at multiple spatial scales; (2) what the impacts of forest management practices on moth diversity are, and (3) how priority Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species respond to management. BAP species were selected as they represent formerly widespread and common species, which have undergone substantial declines in the UK and Europe. We assessed moth communities in three conifer plantations in Northern England and Scotland by light trapping, combining local (e.g. age of planting) and landscape level (e.g. proximity to felled areas) characteristics to evaluate the impacts of forest management on moths. We found no relationship between local factors and moth richness, abundance and diversity but the amount of clear felling in the surrounding landscape had a strongly negative correlation. In contrast, the amount and proximity of broadleaf cover in the surrounding landscape positively influenced macro moth richness and abundance. For six BAP species, abundances were lower close to felled areas but increased with the size of adjacent broadleaf patches. We conclude that clear felling negatively affects moths, probably through alteration of habitats, the loss of larval host plants, and by limiting dispersal. A shift to continuous cover and maintaining broadleaf tree cover within plantations will greatly enhance their value for moth communities.

However, there is growing evidence from multiple regions that bats do make use of plantation landscapes, and as interest in siting onshore wind turbines in upland conifer plantations grows, there is an urgent need to examine whether felling prior to turbine installation is likely to put foraging bats at risk of collision. In the first study of its kind, we use a "before-after-control-impact" study to explore the short-term impacts of clear fell harvest on bat activity in commercial plantations. Thirty-one mature stands of Sitka Spruce were surveyed using acoustic detectors in three large, upland Sitka Spruce plantations in Britain. Eleven stands were felled between 2013 and 2015, and 26 of the original 31 stands were resurveyed in 2015. The change in total bat activity and species- or genus-specific bat activity was modelled before and after felling occurred at both felled and control stands using generalised linear models. There was no change in overall bat activity at felled sites compared to control sites, but activity of Nyctalus species was 23 times higher following felling. Total Pipistrellus spp. activity doubled at felled sites post-harvesting, although this was mainly driven by increased activity at a few felled sites. When P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus were considered separately, activity increased slightly but non-significantly. The size of the felled area influenced activity (for bats overall and Pipistrellus spp.), with 90% higher activity in smaller felled stands (less than 5 ha-1) compared to larger felled stands (greater than 30 ha-1). For P. pipistrellus, activity in felled areas decreased with the duration since harvesting; the greatest activity occurred in stands felled within two months compared to those harvested more than 16 months previously. Higher activity for some groups following felling may occur due to the creation of more edge habitat, which is preferred by both Pipistrellus species we recorded. An increase in activity following the small-scale felling ('key-holing') required for the installation of turbines could put foraging bats at risk from collisions with turbines.

However, the extent to which they may support bat populations is contentious. Many studies have demonstrated active avoidance of coniferous plantations and attributed this to the lack of available roost sites and low invertebrate density. In contrast, other work, carried out in plantation dominated landscapes have shown that certain bat species are able to exploit these areas. However, the extent to which bats use plantations for roosting and foraging, or simply move through the plantation matrix to access more favourable sites is unclear. We radio tracked female Pipistrellus pygmaeus over two summers to establish the extent to which individual bats use Sitka Spruce plantations in southern Scotland for foraging and roosting and assess the implications for felling operations on bats. Maternity roosts identified (n = 17) were in all in buildings and most were large (&gt; 500 individuals). We found no evidence of bats roosting in mature Sitka Spruce crop trees, although several bats used roosts in old or dead beech and oak trees as an alternative to their main maternity roost. Home ranges were much larger (mean 9.6 Â± 3.12 km2) than those reported from other studies (0.6â€“1.6 km2), and it is likely that roost availability rather than food abundance constrains P. pygmaeus use of Sitka Spruce plantations. At the landscape scale, most individuals selected coniferous habitats over other habitat types, covering large distances to access plantation areas, whilst at a local scale bats used forest tracks to access water, felled stands or patches of broadleaf cover within the plantation. Sitka Spruce plantations support a high abundance of Culicoides impuctatus, the Highland midge which may act as a reliable and plentiful food source for females during lactation, an energetically expensive period. The use of felled stands for foraging by bats has implications for forest management as wind turbines, following small-scale felling operations, are increasingly being installed in plantations; wind turbines have been associated with high bat mortality in some countries. Decisions about siting wind turbines in upland plantations should consider the likelihood of increased bat activity post felling. Â© 2018 Kirkpatrick et al.

Various differences were found in the bird-life of Scots and Corsican Pine. The titmouse population of the Breckland differed markedly in two winters. The winter populations of conifer plantations in other parts of Britain are summarized. In general, all heathland birds disappear within a few years of afforestation of heathland, and the scrub birds that replace them are in turn replaced after a few years by tree birds. [Cf. For.

Further changes in bird-life caused by afforestation.	Journal of Animal Ecology	10.2307/1536		Further changes in the bird-life of the Breckland, consequent on the growth of Pine plantations, are described for both summer and winter, and summarized. Various differences were found in the bird-life of Scots and Corsican Pine. The titmouse population of the Breckland differed markedly in two winters. The winter populations of conifer plantations in other parts of Britain are summarized. In general, all heathland birds disappear within a few years of afforestation of heathland, and the scrub birds that replace them are in turn replaced after a few years by tree birds. [Cf. For.

To determine the later changes, we made three visits to this area in the winter of I948-9, and others in April and August I949, April I950 and January I951. The changes described previously referred to the successive stages from bare heath to dense thickets of 14-year-old pines with closely interlocked branches ext6nding to the ground.

Historically dominated by heathland habitats supporting scarce species of restricted distribution within the UK, approximately 47% of Breckland was afforested in the early 20th century. The carabid fauna of this forest, previously little known, was sampled by intensive pitfall trapping, and results compared to samples from heathland and arable. The results affirm that Breckland supports many range-restricted carabid beetles, including scarce species restricted to lowland heathland or sandy habitats. Approximately half of the heathland-associated species, and also half of the Nationally Scarce carabid species recorded in Breckland, were found within the forest landscape. Carabid species composition differed between closed-canopy forest, heathland and arable, while open forest habitats (clear-felled stands, young restocked stands, and track margins) contained a diverse fauna with elements from all habitats. The proportion of heathland-associated species was significantly greater in open forest habitats than in closed-canopy forest and was similar to that of heathland assemblages. Wing morphology did not differ between heathland species solely recorded from heathland and those also recorded in the forest. Nationally Scarce species from the forest had a wider UK distribution than those recorded only from heathland. Our study shows that, within conifer forest planted in lowland heathland areas, open habitats provided by trackway networks and clear-felling management can have significant value for the conservation of open-ground carabids, including species of conservation importance.

Use of a novel camera trapping approach to measure small mammal responses to peatland restoration.	European Journal of Wildlife Research	10.1007/s10344-020-01449-z	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10344-020-01449-z	Small mammals, such as small rodents (Rodentia: Muroidea) and shrews (Insectivora: Soricidae), present particular challenges in camera trap surveys. Their size is often insufficient to trigger infra-red sensors, whilst resultant images may be of inadequate quality for species identification. The conventional survey method for small mammals, live-trapping, can be both labour-intensive and detrimental to animal welfare. Here, we describe a method for using camera traps for monitoring small mammals. We show that by attaching the camera trap to a baited tunnel, fixing a close-focus lens over the camera trap lens, and reducing the flash intensity, pictures or videos can be obtained of sufficient quality for identifying species. We demonstrate the use of the method by comparing occurrences of small mammals in a peatland landscape containing (i) plantation forestry (planted on drained former blanket bog), (ii) ex-forestry areas undergoing bog restoration, and (iii) unmodified blanket bog habitat. Rodents were detected only in forestry and restoration areas, whilst shrews were detected across all habitat. The odds of detecting small mammals were 7.6 times higher on camera traps set in plantation forestry than in unmodified bog, and 3.7 times higher on camera traps in restoration areas than in bog. When absolute abundance estimates are not required, and camera traps are available, this technique provides a low-cost survey method that is labour-efficient and has minimal animal welfare implications.	67	1		Yes	Managed	Landscape	3	2014	2	Scotland	Forsinard, Flow Country, northern Scotland	58.3642178	-3.9499267	trialled a novel technique for camera trapping small mammals and investigated its ability to detect differences in small mammal occurrence between different habitat in bog restoration.

Annual seed food availability, particularly in the spruce plantations, varies markedly and is characterized by years with large cone crops ('mast crops') followed by several years of intermediate or low crops. The last mast crop in Kielder Forest District occurred in 1991 and we studied the two squirrel species when food availability was intermediate and low between 1992 and 1999. Neither red nor grey squirrels in the conifer plantations significantly increased their body weight for the autumn or winter. The responses of red and grey squirrels to the different foraging conditions in deciduous and conifer woodlands and the accumulation of seasonal fat stores may have to be seen in the context of habitat type and the pattern and predictability of seed availability. Our findings suggest that fat accumulation is likely to be less pronounced in conifer habitats where autumn and winter food supplies are more predictable, and manoeuvrability to feed on cones in the canopy is important.	252	4	539-543	Yes	Managed	Stand	3	1992	84	England	Spadeadam Forest	55.07745153	-2.629616994	We studied seasonal body weight changes in red and grey squirrels in the north of England in spruce-dominated conifer forests.

Annual seed food availability, particularly in the spruce plantations, varies markedly and is characterized by years with large cone crops ('mast crops') followed by several years of intermediate or low crops. The last mast crop in Kielder Forest District occurred in 1991 and we studied the two squirrel species when food availability was intermediate and low between 1992 and 1999. Neither red nor grey squirrels in the conifer plantations significantly increased their body weight for the autumn or winter. The responses of red and grey squirrels to the different foraging conditions in deciduous and conifer woodlands and the accumulation of seasonal fat stores may have to be seen in the context of habitat type and the pattern and predictability of seed availability.

Bird Study	10.1080/00063657.2017.1408565	http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tbis20	Capsule: Long-term trends in Merlin Falco columbarius breeding performance remained stable during a period of extensive afforestation in Ireland, where Merlin predominantly select conifer plantations for nesting. Aims: To determine breeding performance and habitat selection of Merlin in a landscape significantly altered by afforestation. Methods: We compiled data on Merlin to determine long-term trends in breeding performance and to examine habitat selection in a country with one of the fastest rates of afforestation in Europe. Results: Merlin predominantly nested in trees (99.5%; n=183 pairs), with a strong preference for conifer plantations, which accounted for over 12 times more nests than expected by random selection. Moors and heathland were strongly selected as land-uses adjacent to nest sites. Most nests were located within 10 m of the forest edge, and in forests aged between 31 and 40 years. Merlin showed positive selection for moors and heathland, peat bogs and natural grasslands within breeding territories, and breeding success was positively related to the proportion of these land-uses surrounding nests. Breeding was successful for 74% of nests (n=300), and mean productivity was 2.1 young per breeding attempt (n=265) between 1982 and 2014. Breeding parameters remained constant over the 33-year study period, despite an increase of more than 75% in forest cover during this time. Conclusion: Merlin breeding performance showed no long-term effects of increased afforestation. Although Merlin predominantly nested in conifer plantations, the presence of nearby open suitable foraging habitats influenced nest site selection and breeding success. The nesting preference of Merlin makes them vulnerable to disturbance from forest operations, which requires mitigation.	64	4	445-454	Yes	Likely Managed	Landscape	1	1982	264	Northern Ireland	Sperins;Antrim hills	54.8002217	-7.083290401	Here we compiled the largest and longest running dataset on breeding Merlin in Ireland to (i) identify breeding site selection at the nest site scale; (ii) quantify Merlin breeding habitat selection at the landscape scale; (iii) determine long-term and regional trends in Merlin breeding performance; (iv) identify the risks associated with forest management activities to breeding Merlin.

Preferences were then related to measures of foraging performance in each habitat. Hen Harriers foraged preferentially over young first rotation coniferous forests, and selected heathland and grassland habitats ahead of closed canopy woodland. Harrier preference for the various habitats was positively correlated with the frequency with which they struck at, and captured, prey. Prey strike success was much lower than that reported for moorland managed for Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. The results explain many of the reported changes in local Hen Harrier populations.

Aims To investigate foraging Hen Harrier activity in relation to vegetation cover and structure and the abundance of potential prey. Methods Forty 1 × 1-km sample observation areas were monitored at four sites in west Scotland. Results Foraging time in the sample squares was dependent on the proximity of harrier nests. Harriers preferred areas with relatively high densities of Field Voles Microtus agrestis and Meadow Pipits Anthus pratensis, associated with tall ground vegetation and shrub layers.

Although fewer species were recorded in the plantation, a log normal pattern of species abundance was observed in both habitats. Only a small proportion of moth species in the plantation were dependent on the conifer trees for larval food supply. -from Author	85		121-132	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	1977	2	Northern Ireland	Banagher Forest	54.8674453	-6.914756145	This paper presents the results of an investigation of the diversity of one group of invertebrates, the Macrolepidoptera, in two contrasting woodland sites at Banagher, Co.

The decline of the raven, Corvus corax, in relation to afforestation in southern Scotland and northern England. Journal of Applied Ecology, pp.129-144.	1978	Marquiss, M., Newton, I., Ratcliffe, D.A.	The decline of the raven, Corvus corax, in relation to afforestation in southern Scotland and northern England	Journal of Applied Ecology			(1) The breeding raven population of southern Scotland and Northumberland was formerly (pre-1960) characterized by year-to-year stability in both numbers and distribution. The 123 known pairs occupied traditional nest-sites on cliffs or trees. Breeding density was correlated with altitude (greatest on high ground) and land productivity (greater on base- poor granite than on sedimentary rocks). This was probably linked with a greater availability of sheep carrion on high ground and base-poor ground. (2) The breeding population has been declining since the 1960s, and in 1974-5 only 55% of former regular nesting areas were still occupied, with breeding pairs reduced to 44%. This was mainly associated with the afforestation of former sheepwalk. The argument is based on a geographical parallel (greatest decline in areas with most afforestation), and on a temporal parallel (desertion of particular nesting areas coincident with planting in the area surround- ing the nest sites). (3) The level of afforestation at which ravens deserted varied between nesting areas. Probably it depended on the overall quality of the original habitat, and the alternative food sources available: good habitat could take more afforestation before it became untenable than could poor habitat. (4) Not all desertion of nesting areas could be attributed to afforestation: four raven pairs were dispossessed from cliff nest-sites by golden eagles which recolonized southern Scotland over the period considered, and at least five other pairs by rock climbers. Sheep management also improved over the years, and may have contributed to the desertion of some marginal nesting areas, by leading to a reduction in the amount of carrion available. Organo-chlorine compounds and persecution are unlikely to have been involved in the decline. (5) In the Lake District, acomparable hill area with practically no afforestation, there was no decline in the numbers of breeding ravens over the same period. (6) Among the pairs studied in 1974-6, those occupying the most heavily afforested ground showed more non-breeding, and produced later, smaller broods than did those on less afforested ground. Those nesting areas still occupied and where more than 25% of former sheepwalk within 5 km had been afforested, produced later and smaller broods than they did before afforestation. (7) To judge from pellets, sheep carrion formed amajor part of the diet, but a great variety of other foods available from grassland was also eaten. The percentage frequency of sheep remains in pellets declined significantly with increasing afforestation in the area around the nest-sites. (8) The prediction is made of a further decline in raven breeding numbers if blanket afforestation continues to expand over former upland sheepwalk.			129-144	Yes	Managed	Landscape	6	1974	24	England;Scotland	South Ayrshire;Galloway;Moniaive;Leadhills;Northumberland;Moffat;Tweedsmuir 	55.2094283	-4.579155095	To investigate the use of nesting areas, breeding performance and food of ravens in relation to the extent of local afforestation; and (b) compare the years that ravens were known to have deserted particular areas with the years of planting.

(7) To judge from pellets, sheep carrion formed amajor part of the diet, but a great variety of other foods available from grassland was also eaten. The percentage frequency of sheep remains in pellets declined significantly with increasing afforestation in the area around the nest-sites. (8) The prediction is made of a further decline in raven breeding numbers if blanket afforestation continues to expand over former upland sheepwalk.			129-144	Yes	Managed	Landscape	6	1974	24	England;Scotland	South Ayrshire;Galloway;Moniaive;Leadhills;Northumberland;Moffat;Tweedsmuir 	55.50670431	-3.432639578	To investigate the use of nesting areas, breeding performance and food of ravens in relation to the extent of local afforestation; and (b) compare the years that ravens were known to have deserted particular areas with the years of planting.

Flock size initially increased, but decreased towards late winter as breeding began. Timing of population increase, and sizes of birds' bills suggested they were mainly immigrants. Their diet changed seasonally in a pattern that could be explained by seed weight, cone toughness and seedfall phenology of the predominant conifers present (Scots pine - Pinus sylvestris; Sitka spruce - Picea sitchensis; Norway spruce - P. abies). No breeding was recorded in autumn and winter when the birds were mainly feeding on Sitka spruce, but commenced in early spring as they shifted to Scots pine. Breeding was late, and production poor, probably because only some of the birds had large enough bills to feed efficiently from the robust cones of Scots pine. It is argued that plantation forestry, by providing a novel range of conifers seeds, could affect selection for bill size in British crossbill populations.	67	1	31-47	Yes	Managed	Forest	2	1990	9	Scotland	Deeside	57.12238925	-2.170607402	This paper reports on (1) population trends in an area of lower Deeside, in northeast Scotland, from January 1990 to December 1991, (2) seasonal shifts in diet within 195 ha of mixed conifer plantation, and (3) breeding performance in the same plantation.

Forestry (Oxford)	10.1093/forestry/67.1.31		Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) increased in abundance on lower Deeside, NE Scotland, from July 1990 through the autumn, remaining numerous until the following June. Flock size initially increased, but decreased towards late winter as breeding began. Timing of population increase, and sizes of birds' bills suggested they were mainly immigrants. Their diet changed seasonally in a pattern that could be explained by seed weight, cone toughness and seedfall phenology of the predominant conifers present (Scots pine - Pinus sylvestris; Sitka spruce - Picea sitchensis; Norway spruce - P. abies). No breeding was recorded in autumn and winter when the birds were mainly feeding on Sitka spruce, but commenced in early spring as they shifted to Scots pine. Breeding was late, and production poor, probably because only some of the birds had large enough bills to feed efficiently from the robust cones of Scots pine. It is argued that plantation forestry, by providing a novel range of conifers seeds, could affect selection for bill size in British crossbill populations.	67	1	31-47	Yes	Managed	Forest	2	1990	9	Scotland	Deeside	57.12238925	-2.170607402	This paper reports on (1) population trends in an area of lower Deeside, in northeast Scotland, from January 1990 to December 1991, (2) seasonal shifts in diet within 195 ha of mixed conifer plantation, and (3) breeding performance in the same plantation.

Enhancement had not successfully created plantations botanically more woodland-like and plantation types were not constant; however, plant species richness had increased. This was also true of the insect assemblages (Coleoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera), which showed more variation in composition, though woodland communities could still be distinguished.

Bird species diversity was also greatest in trees over 20 years old, with one exception.Many bird species depend on unafforested moorland, but were not censused since they are too sparsely distributed. Their loss is to be set against the gain in numbers of smaller song birds following afforestation which was inferred from the study plots. From the standpoint of bird conservation, diverse forest structure and the retention of some large unafforested upland areas is advocated.

Patterns of habitat use by female brown long‐eared bats presage negative impacts of woodland conservation management	Journal of Zoology			Reinstating forestry practices, such as coppicing, thinning the understorey and grazing, has become a key element of proposals for improving the conservation value of Broadleaf woodlands in Europe. However, the consequences of such woodland management for bats are poorly understood because of a lack of knowledge concerning their habitat requirements. We studied the brown long- eared bat Plecotus auritusin South East England to determine how their patterns of habitat use could inform conservation management. Radio-tracking of 38 adult females showed that they foraged primarily in woodland and that each had a foraging area (mean = 4.4 ha) that they returned to on successive nights. Core foraging areas (mean = 2.1 ha) were characterized by more cover and greater species diversity in the understorey layer than more peripheral areas. Hedgerows were also used for foraging in the late summer and autumn. Most conservation activities for this species have focused on protecting roosts in houses and other buildings. While such protection is important for bat conservation, efforts should also be made to protect foraging habitats in woodlands by maintaining cover of native species in the understorey layer and hedgerows that provide connectivity between woodland patches. Common conservation management practices, such as reinstating coppic- ing or grazing in semi-natural Broadleaf woodlands, could be detrimental for P. auritus and other woodland bats. Their impact on bats should be tested experi- mentally before they are widely promoted as a woodland conservation strategy.	288	3	177-183	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	2003	72	England	West Sussex;East Sussex;Surrey	50.944584	-0.5278477	We examine ranging behaviour by individual female bats in oak woods in South East England to investigate the influence of woodland structure and composition on their patterns of habitat use.

Understanding how species respond to landscape factors could contribute to preventing further decline of woodland bird populations. Objective: To investigate how woodland birds with different species traits respond to landscape heterogeneity, and to identify whether specific landcover types are important for maintaining diverse populations in wooded-agricultural environments. Methods: Birds were sampled from woodlands in 58 2Â Ã—Â 2Â km tetrads across southern Britain. Landscape heterogeneity was quantified for each tetrad. Bird assemblage response was determined using redundancy analysis combined with variation partitioning and response trait analyses. Results: For woodland bird assemblages, the independent explanatory importance of landscape composition and landscape configuration variables were closely interrelated. When considered simultaneously during variation partitioning, the community response was better represented by compositional variables. Different species responded to different landscape features and this could be explained by traits relating to woodland association, foraging strata and nest location. Ubiquitous, generalist species, many of which were hole-nesters or ground foragers, correlated positively with urban landcover while specialists of Broadleaf woodland avoided landscapes containing urban areas. Species typical of coniferous woodland correlated with large conifer plantations. Conclusions: At the 2Â Ã—Â 2Â km scale, there was evidence that the availability of resources provided by proximate landcover types was highly important for shaping woodland bird assemblages. Further research to disentangle the effects of composition and configuration at different spatial scales is advocated.

The heterogeneity of wooded-agricultural landscape mosaics influences woodland bird community assemblages	Landscape Ecology	10.1007/s10980-016-0366-x	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961773437&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-016-0366-x&partnerID=40&md5=40ff967b6690681697c51bb1770bb465	Context: Landscape heterogeneity (the composition and configuration of different landcover types) plays a key role in shaping woodland bird assemblages in wooded-agricultural mosaics. Understanding how species respond to landscape factors could contribute to preventing further decline of woodland bird populations. Objective: To investigate how woodland birds with different species traits respond to landscape heterogeneity, and to identify whether specific landcover types are important for maintaining diverse populations in wooded-agricultural environments. Methods: Birds were sampled from woodlands in 58 2Â Ã—Â 2Â km tetrads across southern Britain. Landscape heterogeneity was quantified for each tetrad. Bird assemblage response was determined using redundancy analysis combined with variation partitioning and response trait analyses. Results: For woodland bird assemblages, the independent explanatory importance of landscape composition and landscape configuration variables were closely interrelated. When considered simultaneously during variation partitioning, the community response was better represented by compositional variables. Different species responded to different landscape features and this could be explained by traits relating to woodland association, foraging strata and nest location. Ubiquitous, generalist species, many of which were hole-nesters or ground foragers, correlated positively with urban landcover while specialists of Broadleaf woodland avoided landscapes containing urban areas. Species typical of coniferous woodland correlated with large conifer plantations. Conclusions: At the 2Â Ã—Â 2Â km scale, there was evidence that the availability of resources provided by proximate landcover types was highly important for shaping woodland bird assemblages. Further research to disentangle the effects of composition and configuration at different spatial scales is advocated.

Breeding of sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) in different environments	Journal of Animal Ecology			This paper describes the timing and success of breeding by sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (Linn.) in different environments in southern Scotland, from 395 nests found in 1971-73. It forms part of a wider study, which is aimed at finding what is currentiy limiting numbers, and particularly at assessing the influence of organo-chlorine pesticides. Until these compounds came into widespread use, the sparrowhawk was common throughout Britain and, despite heavy persecution from gamekeepers, maintained its numbers well. Since 1947 when DDT came into wide use, it has laid thin-shelled eggs, with a consequent reduction in breeding success; and after 1955 when the more toxic cyclodiene compounds (aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor) were introduced as cereal seed-dressings, it suffered a massive population decline (Prestt 1965; Ratcliffe 1970; Newton 1974). With successive restrictions since 1962 on the use of such compounds, the species has begun to recover, and in southern Scotland is numerous again (Newton 1973). The sparrowhawks studied nested only in woodland, especially in conifer stands; they used the same restricted nesting territories in different years (confirming Uttendorfer 1939; Tinbergen 1946; Kramer 1955; Hald-Mortensen 1974 and others), but usually built a new nest each year near old ones. They mostly began building in March/April and egg laying in early May, so that the young hatched in June, fledged in July, and dispersed from the nesting territories in August. (The nesting territory was the area around the nest that was defended against other sparrowhawks and other predators, and did not include more distant hunting areas.) Hunting occurred in both woods and other habitats, and the prey consisted of whatever small birds were available locally. Most prey species (like the hawks themselves) were non-migratory in this region, and were more numerous in valleys than in hills (Moss 1976).			831-849	No	Not applicable 	Forest	1	1971	36	Scotland	Esk Valley;Annan;Ae Forest	55.863885	-3.264893	This paper describes the timing and success of breeding by sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (Linn.) in different environments in southern Scotland, from 395 nests found in 1971-73.

The sparrowhawks studied nested only in woodland, especially in conifer stands; they used the same restricted nesting territories in different years (confirming Uttendorfer 1939; Tinbergen 1946; Kramer 1955; Hald-Mortensen 1974 and others), but usually built a new nest each year near old ones. They mostly began building in March/April and egg laying in early May, so that the young hatched in June, fledged in July, and dispersed from the nesting territories in August. (The nesting territory was the area around the nest that was defended against other sparrowhawks and other predators, and did not include more distant hunting areas.) Hunting occurred in both woods and other habitats, and the prey consisted of whatever small birds were available locally. Most prey species (like the hawks themselves) were non-migratory in this region, and were more numerous in valleys than in hills (Moss 1976).			831-849	No	Not applicable 	Forest	1	1971	36	Scotland	Esk Valley;Annan;Ae Forest	54.993919	-3.309587	This paper describes the timing and success of breeding by sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (Linn.) in different environments in southern Scotland, from 395 nests found in 1971-73.

Journal of Applied Ecology	10.2307/2404744		Between 1946 and 1993, the numbers of territorial red kites, which form an isolated relict population in central Wales, increased from seven pairs to 113 pairs. Throughout this period, concern has repeatedly been expressed that the afforestation of the Welsh uplands might affect kites adversely, by reducing the area of open foraging habitat. At present, only 16% of the total area used by kites in Wales is under trees. The several analyses performed here gave no firm indication that conifer afforestation up to current levels has had any detrimental effects on the distribution, numbers or breeding performance of kites. Within the local landscape, kites preferred areas rich in native oaks [Quercus] and other broadleaved trees in which to nest.

Birch in Spruce Plantations			The results of a lichen survey of spruce plantations in Northumberland, the Southern Uplands and the Southwest Highlands are presented. The lichen flora associated with pure spruce stands (Picea sitchensis and P. abies) was compared with the flora of young and mature birch stands, and semi-natural oakwoods. A total of 73 species were recorded on birch, with mature stands (42-57 years old) carrying a more diverse flora than young stands (13-23 years old). M ost species were part of the acidophilous com m unity Pseudevernietum grading into the Parmelietum laevigatae community in high rainfall areas. Oak carried a generally less acidophilous flora than birch, and included the Lobarion com m unity w hich is of high conservation importance. The lichen flora of spruce stands was impoverished when compared to birch and oak, with only 39 species recorded and community development was poor. This is attributable to the unsuitability of spruce bark as a substrate (due to its low pH), the lack of old trees and deadwood, excessive shade in densely stocked stands, and the lack of ecological continuity associated with the patch clearfelling system. It is proposed that lichen diversity in com m ercial spruce forests can be improved by: encouraging birch and other native species at all stages of the rotation, retaining semi- natural stands, and exploring the use of continuous- cover silviculture to prom ote continuity of woodland conditions and other features of 'old- growth' such as older trees and deadwood.			25-30	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1993	2	England;Scotland	Loch Awe;Kintyre;Ae;Kielder Forest	56.31884693	-5.209490689	To understand the sensitivity of lichens to the nature of the substratum, and to disturbance and management, in commercial spruce plantations.

Marginal habitat characteristics differed between streams with different riparian management. Streams with "harder' margins occurred where the banks were covered with either conifers or broadleaves. Streams with "softer' margins occurred in seminatural moorland, and where a buffer strip of moorland vegetation had been retained along the stream at the planting stage. Streams in conifer forest in which a riparian buffer strip had been cleared retrospectively were intermediate. For any given pH, aluminium concentrations were significantly higher in streams draining conifer catchments than in streams draining whole catchments of moorland or deciduous woodland. The taxon richnesses of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and all taxa combined, in both riffles and margins, declined significantly with increasing acidity and aluminium concentration. Primary ordination axes form both habitats correlated with taxon richness, and hence also with pH and aluminium. However, there were significant effects on the ordination scores by riparian management, due mostly to reduced taxon richnesses in conifer sites without buffer strips. -from Authors	30	1	13-24	Yes	Likely Managed	Stand	5	1990	2	England;Wales		NA		In this paper, we assess the effects of several methods of riparian management on the habitat structure of 66 streams throughout the uplands of Wales and Scotland.

Carr.] in Northumberland, Northern England, were analysed; mycorrhizal root samples were taken from 6-, 12-, 30- and 40-year-old stands, and fungal fruiting bodies were collected in autumn to complement the survey. Naturally germinated seedlings less than 1 year of age (taken from the 30-year-old stand) were also examined. A total of 118,000 mycorrhizal root tips were extracted from 40 soil cores (ten per age class) and from the complete root systems of 25 seedlings and separated into active and senescent root tips according to their morphology and anatomy. Active tips were distinguished according to their mycobionts which were characterised and identified microscopically. Although almost 100% of all fine roots were mycorrhizal, EM fungal diversity throughout the chronosequence was low, consisting of a total of 16 species of which three were only found as fruiting bodies. Of the six mycobionts found most regularly below ground, Tylospora fibrillosa was the most common, colonising about 70% of all root tips and more than 90% of those of seedlings and young trees. Root density and mycorrhizal diversity increased, but percentage of vital root tips decreased with increasing tree age, levelling off in the 30- and 40-year-old stand. Among the five subdominant fungal species, Dermocybe crocea was found to have its peak of distribution in the 12-year-old stand and Russula emetica, Lactarius rufus, Hymenoscyphus ericae agg. and the unidentified Piceirhiza sulfo-incrustata in the 30- and 40-year-old stands. The possible correlations between the mycorrhizal community structure and biotic and abiotic factors are discussed.	15	8	571-579	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	2000	12	England	Hardwood Forest	55.24621382	-2.005735423	To sample populations of a single tree species established over a known chronosequence.

In particular, we were interested in how these variables could be manipulated in order to increase the abundance of bilberry, a species that contributes substantially to pinewood biodiversity. Bilberry cover was greatest at intermediate irradiance, which coincided with high crown forest stands, and was least in the thicket stages of forest development. It was also less abundant where there was a high level of browsing. By contrast, heather cover and height increased with irradiance. In order to increase bilberry in Scots pine woodland, and thereby enhance woodland for wildlife, managers should aim to match stand densities to particular tree heights to provide the best light conditions for bilberry, allowing it to compete successfully against heather. This may mean reducing tree densities in plantations, but increasing them in the more open stands of native pinewoods. Because browsing by deer appears to reduce bilberry abundance, it may also be important to reduce numbers of deer to increase bilberry. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The breeding ecology and diet of the Hobby Falco subbuteo in southern England	Ibis	10.1111/j.1474-919X.1985.tb05037.x	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022170215&doi=10.1111%2fj.1474-919X.1985.tb05037.x&partnerID=40&md5=8c5682ffa9631bcbbd4ad599621fad62	Brecding densities, nest spacing, breeding habitat, productivity and diet are compared for Hobbies Falco subbuteo in the New Forest (heathland and largely coniferous woodland), river valley farmland and largely cultivated chalk downland. Regular spacing of nests was characteristic of the three areas. The New Forest had the highest density and lowest mean nearest neighbour distance for nests. Nest areas tended to be traditional. A high proportion of clutches were laid in disused nests of Carrion Crows Corvus corone which favoured the crowns of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris. Except on downland, the availability of such sites is unlikely to provide a constraint on Hobby distribution. In the New Forest, woodland clearings and valley mires were a feature of nest territories. There was no evidence of a habitatâ€related difference in fledging success. Division of labour between sexes is marked. The male is responsible for provisioning the female throughout most of the breeding season as well as the young. During the incubation period many woodland passerines were taken but when feeding nestlings Hobbies tended to specialize on Swallows Hirundo rustica, House Martins Delichon urbica and, where they had access to more urban areas, Swifts Apus apus. By breeding relatively late, Hobbies take advantage of the availability of the juveniles of such prey on which to feed their young. Large insects supplemented the diet before eggâ€laying and when the Hedged young were learning to hunt. Copyright Â© 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

The population prior to 1986 is not accurately known; but from 1970-75 was at least 5-10 pairs and probably 10-20 pairs. After this time pairs switched nest sites from tradi-tional moorland trees to the edges of conifer plantations, and, because these latter nest areas were not checked for occupancy until 1986, the population over the last 10 years may have declined as in other areas or simply switched nest site, or both. The limited evidence suggests that the population has remained stable or may have declined slightly. Between 1986 and 1989, the population was 10-20 pairs, the highest recorded population of the three survey periods. Over 90% of these were breeding in conifer plantation edges. The nest site switch involved a significant increase of altitude of up to 200 m, but there was a tendency for nest areas to be located close to the old upland valley nest areas. Judgement should be reserved as to the relative importance of grass and heather-dominated moorland to breeding Merlins. If the 1986-89 data are true for the whole of Wales, the present population is at least 60-70 pairs, significantly higher than the 1982-84 estimate of 40-45 pairs, but similar to the figure for the 1970s. The use of commercial forestry plantations as nest sites requires further study throughout Britain.

Bird Study	https://doi.org/10.1080/00063659409477196		Annual surveys of breeding Merlins were carried out between 1970 and 1991 with more systematic effort from 1982 onwards. Mean annual occupancy rates did not differ significantly between heather, moorland tree and conifer plantation nest areas. Mean occupancy rates declined significantly in heather and moorland tree nest areas between 1970 and 1991. These declines are probably associated with a progressive switch to conifer plantation nest areas that have ultimately affected over 50% of breeding pairs. The Welsh population has probably remained relatively stable throughout the study period at approximately 60-70 pairs. The switch to conifer plantations is related to habitat; the switch was most pronounced on the grass moors of central and south Wales and probably occurred between 1975 and 1985, whereas on the heather moors of north Wales only a small number of ground-nesting sites have been vacated since 1985. This was partly due to the lack of afforestation on most of the Berwyn Mountains. The population changes in Wales are compared with those in other regions of Britain. It is suggested that, with the exception of the Northern Isles, the British breeding Merlin population no longer merits special conservation concern and should be removed from the 'Red Data' list of British birds.

In each of the two study areas, at Cowal, Argyll and Kielder, Northumberland, 88 study plots were selected randomly from 24 combinations of tree age (0-8, 9-15, 16-25 and over 25 (mainly 25-50) years), plot size (1-2, 2.1-5 and over 5 ha) and elevation (above or below 250 m). Both pure Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis and mixed conifers were included, as were first and second rotation crops. Point counts, at up to five per plot, were used to estimate bird populations and in larger plots, additional edge points allowed the comparison of plot centres and edges. Counts were made from 1990 to 1992 in winter (mid-November to mid-March), early spring (mid-April to mid-May) and late spring (mid-May to mid-June). Each plot was visited once in each period. The counting method gave consistent results both within and between days at the same counting points. There was strong and significant variation in bird numbers and species richness with tree age, both being highest in older trees in winter and in 9-25 year old trees in spring. All of the common species-chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, coal tit Parus ater, crossbill Loxia curvirostra, dunnock Prunella modularis, goldcrest Regulus regulus, meadow pipit Anthus pratensis, robin Erithacus rubecula, redpoll Carduelis flammea, siskin Carduelis spinus, song thrush Turdus ericetorum, tree pipit Anthus trivialis, wren Troglodytes troglodytes and willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus-showed significant variation in their abundance between tree-age categories, with all except the meadow pipit having lowest numbers in the youngest trees and their highest in 9-25 year old trees. There was little detectable effect of plot size, altitude, admixture of other conifer species or planting generation on either bird numbers or species richness. The number of individual birds detected was consistently higher at the edges than in the centres of the same plots, particularly in the first 10 m from the edge, but the type of habitat outside the plot had little effect on this. Spring numbers of most of the common species that were also resident in winter were significantly correlated with their winter numbers, but the correlations were weak (particularly in 1991/1992) and had little predictive value. The two study areas and the 2 years were similar in the way in which bird numbers and species richness varied with forest characteristics, suggesting that the conclusions may be of wide relevance. Bird numbers tended to be higher in 1991 than in 1992, owing mainly to there being more crossbills and siskins in 1991, when there was a very large cone crop. The study clearly identified tree age and closeness to the forest edge as the two main factors affecting the number and species richness of birds in upland spruce plantations. This suggests that the greatest number and variety of birds could be encouraged by creating mosaics of small patches (i.e. with a high ratio of edge habitat), with a mixture of tree ages, including a large proportion of 9-25 year old trees.

All of the common species-chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, coal tit Parus ater, crossbill Loxia curvirostra, dunnock Prunella modularis, goldcrest Regulus regulus, meadow pipit Anthus pratensis, robin Erithacus rubecula, redpoll Carduelis flammea, siskin Carduelis spinus, song thrush Turdus ericetorum, tree pipit Anthus trivialis, wren Troglodytes troglodytes and willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus-showed significant variation in their abundance between tree-age categories, with all except the meadow pipit having lowest numbers in the youngest trees and their highest in 9-25 year old trees. There was little detectable effect of plot size, altitude, admixture of other conifer species or planting generation on either bird numbers or species richness. The number of individual birds detected was consistently higher at the edges than in the centres of the same plots, particularly in the first 10 m from the edge, but the type of habitat outside the plot had little effect on this. Spring numbers of most of the common species that were also resident in winter were significantly correlated with their winter numbers, but the correlations were weak (particularly in 1991/1992) and had little predictive value. The two study areas and the 2 years were similar in the way in which bird numbers and species richness varied with forest characteristics, suggesting that the conclusions may be of wide relevance. Bird numbers tended to be higher in 1991 than in 1992, owing mainly to there being more crossbills and siskins in 1991, when there was a very large cone crop. The study clearly identified tree age and closeness to the forest edge as the two main factors affecting the number and species richness of birds in upland spruce plantations. This suggests that the greatest number and variety of birds could be encouraged by creating mosaics of small patches (i.e. with a high ratio of edge habitat), with a mixture of tree ages, including a large proportion of 9-25 year old trees.

Many causes for this decline have been suggested, notably agricultural intensification, increased grazing levels and moorland afforestation. We examine habitat correlates of Black Grouse distribution and population change from a 700-km2 area in the core of the Scottish range, where the numbers of lekking male Black Grouse declined by an estimated 70% to 270 between 1990 and 2002. Habitat data were derived from satellite imagery, in combination with map and field-collected data. Lek occurrence, lek size and changes in lek size were all correlated with forest structure, either positively with the amount of pre-thicket forest cover, or negatively with closed canopy cover. Additional effects of the cover of grass moor and dry heath suggest that Black Grouse are most likely to occur where moorland comprises Heather Calluna vulgaris and grass mosaics. Analysis of the change in Black Grouse abundance within 1.5 km of discrete forest blocks suggests that forest maturation, which has been the dominant habitat change during the course of the study, alone accounts for 58-78% of the decline. Given the close association of Black Grouse and the occurrence of woodland (and particularly conifer plantation) throughout much of their British range, these findings can be used to inform the design of management schemes for the recovery of Black Grouse.

Within plantation forestry, trackways provide contiguous permanent open-habitat with potential to enhance biodiversity. We examined the ground-active spider assemblage in the trackway network of Thetford Forest, Eastern England, the largest lowland conifer forest in the UK, created by afforestation of heathland and farmland. Results are relevant to other forests in heath regions across Europe. We used pitfall trapping to sample the spider assemblage of trackways within thicket-aged stands (n = 17), mature stands (n = 13) and heathland reference sites (n = 9). A total of 9,314 individuals of 71 species were recorded. Spider assemblages of the trackway network were distinct from those of the heathland reference sites; however, trackways were found to support specialist species associated with grass-heath habitats, including nationally scarce species. Richness of grass-heath species was similar for trackways in thicket-aged forest and heathland reference sites, although the abundance of individuals was three times greater in the reference sites. Trackways in mature stands had lower grass-heath species richness and abundance than both thicket trackways and heath reference sites. Wide trackways within thicket stands contained greater richness and abundance of specialist xeric species than narrower trackways. However, fewer xeric individuals were found in trackways compared to heathland reference sites. Either inferior habitat quality in trackways or poor dispersal ability of specialist xeric species may largely restrict these to relict areas of heathland. Targeted widening of trackways to allow permanent unshaded habitat and creating early successional stages by mechanical disturbance regimes could improve trackway suitability for specialist species, helping to restore connectivity networks for grass-heath biodiversity.

Results are relevant to other forests in heath regions across Europe. We used pitfall trapping to sample the spider assemblage of trackways within thicket-aged stands (n = 17), mature stands (n = 13) and heathland reference sites (n = 9). A total of 9,314 individuals of 71 species were recorded. Spider assemblages of the trackway network were distinct from those of the heathland reference sites; however, trackways were found to support specialist species associated with grass-heath habitats, including nationally scarce species. Richness of grass-heath species was similar for trackways in thicket-aged forest and heathland reference sites, although the abundance of individuals was three times greater in the reference sites. Trackways in mature stands had lower grass-heath species richness and abundance than both thicket trackways and heath reference sites. Wide trackways within thicket stands contained greater richness and abundance of specialist xeric species than narrower trackways. However, fewer xeric individuals were found in trackways compared to heathland reference sites. Either inferior habitat quality in trackways or poor dispersal ability of specialist xeric species may largely restrict these to relict areas of heathland. Targeted widening of trackways to allow permanent unshaded habitat and creating early successional stages by mechanical disturbance regimes could improve trackway suitability for specialist species, helping to restore connectivity networks for grass-heath biodiversity.

There have been widespread changes in land use in the uplands of the UK but the implications for dispersal of adult stages of aquatic invertebrates are poorly known. We estimated the lateral dispersal of adult aquatic insects (Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera) in seven small, upland streams draining catchments under three categories of land use (coniferous plantation forest, cleared forest, moorland). 2. Malaise traps were set out in transects perpendicular to each stream. More than 29 000 adult insects were taken, distributed among 15 species of stoneflies, 40 species of caddisflies and eight taxa of mayflies. Overall species diversity and equitability were highest in the moorland catchments, and few species were numerous in all catchments. 3. Nearly all the mayflies were taken in the moorland catchments, where caddisflies were also most abundant. Fewest stoneflies were taken in the forested catchments. 4. The vast majority of insects were taken either directly over, or very close to, the stream channel. Half the stoneflies were taken within 18 m of the channel, while 90% had travelled less than 60 m. Caddisflies and mayflies travelled even shorter distances. Although there were differences in lateral dispersal between some catchments, there was no overall effect of land use. 5. The overall sex ratio in stoneflies and mayflies in the riparian zone was close to 1:1 and lateral dispersal was similar between the sexes. Male mayflies outnumbered females in the riparian zone and males travelled further from the stream, on average, than females. In catches taken directly over the stream, female stoneflies outnumbered males. 6. Regardless of land use, the flight of mayflies and caddisflies was concentrated along the stream, rather than perpendicular to it. This was also true for two numerous stoneflies (Amphinemura sulcilcollis and Protonemura meyeri) and for female stoneflies overall. 7. Synthesis and applications. The stream corridor, including the riparian strip extending 10-20 m on either side of the channel, is the main habitat for adult aquatic insects, and its management may affect the biodiversity of aquatic communities. The stream corridor is also revealed as the main 'highway' for adult dispersal. While there is no evidence from this study of an effect on interstream dispersal of land use elsewhere in the catchment, such an effect cannot yet be refuted because rare long-distance dispersal events are difficult to record.	41	5	934-950	No	Not applicable 	Landscape	1	2000	6	Wales	Llyn Brianne, mid-Wales	52.138281	-3.735988	We estimated the lateral dispersal of adult aquatic insects (Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera) in seven small, upland streams draining catchments under three cat- egories of land use (coniferous plantation forest, cleared forest, moorland).

Spatial synchrony in field vole Microtus agrestis abundance in a coniferous forest in northern England: the role of vole‐eating raptors. 	Journal of Applied Ecology			1. The regional synchrony hypothesis (RSH) states that synchrony in microtine abundance over large geographical areas is caused by nomadic avian predators that specialize on small mammals for food. This has proved a dicult hypothesis to test because experiments at an appropriate scale are almost impossible. 2. We used the decline of the most abundant, nomadic vole-eating raptors in an extensive conifer forest in northern England (Kielder Forest) as a natural experiment to evaluate their in¯uence on synchronizing voles at dierent spatial scales. Field vole populations ¯uctuated on a 3±4-year cycle of abundance, similar to the periodicity in central Fennoscandia. 3. Over a 23-year period, the combined numbers and density of kestrels and shorteared owls signi®cantly declined. If these raptors were responsible for synchronizing vole abundance, the decline should have been associated with a decrease in synchrony. We could ®nd no change in synchrony during the period of the greatest decline in kestrel and short-eared owl numbers (1980±97). 4. In Kielder, vole abundance has been shown to change in a wave-like manner, with synchrony in the direction of the wave being 5±10-fold smaller than that reported in Fennoscandia. Tawny owls are sedentary and the most abundant voleeating raptor in our study area, and might have an equalizing in¯uence on vole abundance over smaller areas if they foraged in a density-dependent manner and responded functionally to increasing vole density. If this was the case, spatial variability in vole density should have been less in occupied than unoccupied owl territories, especially in years of low vole density when owls could take a larger proportion of the standing crop of voles. Even though tawny owls caught a signi®- cant proportion of the vole population, we could ®nd no dierence in variation in vole density between owl territories that were unoccupied, occupied with no breeding attempt, or occupied with a successful breeding attempt. 5. We conclude that the small-scale synchrony in ®eld vole abundance is unlikely to be caused by avian predators. Instead, it is more likely to be related to the pattern of clear-cutting that has developed in Kielder, which restricts vole dispersal. If this assumption is correct, we would predict more widespread synchrony in vole abundance in ®rst-generation forests when extensive areas are planted over short periods of time, and this is supported by anecdotal evidence. These conclusions indicate that foresters may be able to manipulate the spatial dynamics of voles and vole predators by varying patch sizes within forests.	37		136-147	No	Not applicable 	Forest	1	1975	264	England	Kielder Forest	55.23560651	-2.580073022	In this paper we focus on the role of vole-eating raptors in synchronizing ®eld vole Microtus agrestis L. abundance in an extensive conifer forest in northern England.

Keillour forest in Perthshire is dominated by Sitka spruce, has little blaeberry, yet had a high density of capercaillie. Food and habitat use by capercaillie were studied there from 1991 to 1994. Seven cocks and two hens were caught, and marked with small radio transmitters. The habitats they occupied and food remains in their droppings provided information on home range, habitat utilization and diet through the year. Sitka spruce was the main food in autumn, winter and spring but was equalled by the fruiting heads of sedge in summer. Larch was the second most abundant item in spring and autumn diets. Sedge was plentiful on the wet restocks associated with the gleyed soils at Keillour and may provide a partial substitute for blaeberry in summer. Capercaillie showed a clear preference for the oldest blocks of trees, especially in winter. Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Scots pine were used roughly in proportion to their availability in the birds' home range, but larch stands were used more than expected from availability. In summer, all birds used restocks to some extent. Management recommendations to encourage capercaillie in commercial plantations largely comprising exotics are that mature stands over 45 years and well-vegetated restocks should each occupy at least 20 per cent of the forest, larch and blocks of mixed conifers each at least 15 per cent of the ground. Blaeberry should be encouraged and, if possible, patches of windthrow involving living trees with the main root intact should be retained.	69	4	372-388	Yes	Managed	Stand	2	1991	48	Scotland	Keillour Forest	56.41296586	-3.660927179	The present study documents for the first time both the diet and the habitat preferences of adult capercaillie throughout the year in a plan- tation dominated by Sitka spruce.

Keillour forest in Perthshire is dominated by Sitka spruce, has little blaeberry, yet had a high density of capercaillie. Food and habitat use by capercaillie were studied there from 1991 to 1994. Seven cocks and two hens were caught, and marked with small radio transmitters. The habitats they occupied and food remains in their droppings provided information on home range, habitat utilization and diet through the year. Sitka spruce was the main food in autumn, winter and spring but was equalled by the fruiting heads of sedge in summer. Larch was the second most abundant item in spring and autumn diets. Sedge was plentiful on the wet restocks associated with the gleyed soils at Keillour and may provide a partial substitute for blaeberry in summer. Capercaillie showed a clear preference for the oldest blocks of trees, especially in winter. Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Scots pine were used roughly in proportion to their availability in the birds' home range, but larch stands were used more than expected from availability. In summer, all birds used restocks to some extent. Management recommendations to encourage capercaillie in commercial plantations largely comprising exotics are that mature stands over 45 years and well-vegetated restocks should each occupy at least 20 per cent of the forest, larch and blocks of mixed conifers each at least 15 per cent of the ground.

Restoration trajectory of carabid functional traits in a formerly afforested Blanket bog.

Restoration monitoring often places fauna as secondary in importance to water table depth and vegetation, and when carried out, it often focuses on taxonomic indices. The use of functional traits, however, can be a complementary approach that clarifies mechanistic links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This study was conducted in large blanket bog site in northern Scotland, using a space-for-time-substitution of restoration sites from which conifer plantations had been removed 2-18 years previously. Carabid beetles were sampled by pitfall trapping in each of three treatments (undamaged bog, restored, afforested). Functional trait data were summarised from available literature. The study found that sites under forestry had different functional traits than blanket bog, and that restoration initially shifted the suites of functional traits away from both forested and open blanket bog. However, no other change in functional traits was observed, and after two decades, restoration sites continue to support carabid communities with higher dispersal capacity and more diurnal activity than the open bog. On the other hand, the functional diversity measures used in this study failed to differentiate the different treatments and further analyses suggest that environment, rather than traits, better explain carabid beetle composition following restoration of formerly afforested blanket bog. In particular, the lack of recovery of typical blanket bog vegetation and microhabitat following felling to waste and drain blocking appear to limit carabid functional recovery.	65		33-56	No	Not applicable 	Stand	18	2015	4	Scotland	Forsinard Flows National Nature Reserve, Sutherland, northern Scotland	58.357	-3.897	Compare Carabids in former confierous plantation vs bog, using a space-for-time substitution based on six restoration age classes (2, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 18 years since onset of restoration management) 	Pairwise comparison chronosequence	Systematic	24	Sitka spruce	Bog	Single Age, Single Storey	Monoculture	Clear-cut		1st	Not applicable	Morphology	Note the study considers the commerical plantation as a control; whereas this systematic map considers the bog as the control at 17 different stages (years since clearfelling)	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Forest floor	Carabus glabratus;Carabus problematicus;Cychrus caraboides;Dyschirius globosus;Pterostichus adstrictus;Pterostichus niger;Pterostichus diligens;Notiophilus biguttatus;Notiophilus germinyi;Leistus terminatus;Loricera pilicornis;Nebria salina;Patrobus assimilis;Pterostichus nigrita;Trechus obtusus;Agonum fuliginosum;Agonum ericeti;			Carabus glabratus;Carabus problematicus;Cychrus caraboides;Dyschirius globosus;Pterostichus adstrictus;Pterostichus niger;Pterostichus diligens;Notiophilus biguttatus;Notiophilus germinyi;Leistus terminatus;Loricera pilicornis;Nebria salina;Patrobus assimilis;Pterostichus nigrita;Trechus obtusus;Agonum fuliginosum;Agonum ericeti;	Species with limited dispersal capability and nocturnal diel activity dominated in open blanket bog compared with restoration areas.

We investigated broad patterns of distribution in moth communities during the restoration of formerly afforested blanket bog, as well as their degree of habitat affinity (tyrphophilia). Thus, we examined the response of moth communities to peatland management across a restoration chronosequence and used information about species traits to explain the species' responses to restoration (trait syndromes). A clear shift towards open habitat moth species and away from specialist forest species took place following tree felling, and the moth communities of restoration treatments resembled the bog community within a few years following onset of restoration. Interestingly, species traditionally considered tyrphobionts (bog specialists) were not restricted to core bog habitats. Trait syndromes were identified for each treatment, highlighting the importance of phylogenetic, phenological and ecological performance traits linked mainly to species microhabitat selection, resource use and dispersal capability. The restoration of afforested blanket bog opens up the habitat for the recolonisation of bog-inhabiting moth species, mediated by species functional traits. However, a better understanding of moth functional traits, especially linked to moth ecology (including habitat preferences), is needed to aid understanding of the relationship between restoration trajectory, species traits and blanket bog habitat.	26	27		No	Likely Managed	Landscape/Stand	2	2013	48	Scotland	Forsinard Flows	58.35859213	-3.919770329	1) quantify changes in moth communities across a restoration chronosequence; and 2) identify key trait- habitat associations (trait syndromes).

We quantify afforestation across the North York Moors National Park, UK, deriving a chronology of afforestation from historic maps at six time points from 1854 to 2013. We map the location of current wood ant (Formica lugubris) nests and set their distribution in the context of historic forest cover. We use these nest locations and the features of the habitat in which they occur to model the suitability of recently established conifer plantations for wood ants using MaxEnt. We determine whether non-native conifers offer suitable habitat for a forest specialist species, and assess the lag between establishment of conifer plantations and colonisation by wood ants from historic woodland fragments. Forest cover increased by 229% over 160. years and is now dominated by non-native conifer plantations. Our survey data show that current wood ant populations extend hundreds of metres from where forest was in the past, demonstrating geographical population expansions into newly formed forest, comprised of non-native conifer plantations.

Do non-native conifer plantations provide benefits for a native forest specialist, the wood ant Formica lugubris?	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.034	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939428505&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2015.07.034&partnerID=40&md5=d39fe774b23c42d186da78d17af35b10	Recent increases in plantation forestry are starting to reverse the global decline in forest cover, in some areas of the world. Britain has practiced afforestation, primarily with non-native conifers, for over a century. It is unclear whether these new plantations have the potential to support native forest species. We quantify afforestation across the North York Moors National Park, UK, deriving a chronology of afforestation from historic maps at six time points from 1854 to 2013. We map the location of current wood ant (Formica lugubris) nests and set their distribution in the context of historic forest cover. We use these nest locations and the features of the habitat in which they occur to model the suitability of recently established conifer plantations for wood ants using MaxEnt. We determine whether non-native conifers offer suitable habitat for a forest specialist species, and assess the lag between establishment of conifer plantations and colonisation by wood ants from historic woodland fragments. Forest cover increased by 229% over 160. years and is now dominated by non-native conifer plantations. Our survey data show that current wood ant populations extend hundreds of metres from where forest was in the past, demonstrating geographical population expansions into newly formed forest, comprised of non-native conifer plantations. Both our data and model reveal that the recently planted non-native conifer plantations are a suitable habitat for this forest specialist species. Our model reveals that Formica lugubris has not yet spread through all available suitable habitat due to very poor dispersal ability, displaying a severe lag behind the availability of habitat. Managers should not assume that unoccupied habitat is unsuitable nor should they expect to see immediate colonisation of plantations. Future forest creation should be targeted close to existing forests to facilitate colonisation of forest specialists.

Bat flight, foraging and social activity in natural birch woodland was compared with that in managed non-native coniferous woodland. Each area consists of riparian habitat, meadow-forest ecotone and dense forest. The activity of bats was highest in riparian habitat, then meadow, and lowest in dense woodland.

In natural birch woodland, meadow habitat was most preferred by P. pipistrellus, and there was no significant difference between the use of riparian and woodland habitats, whereas in coniferous woodland, riparian habitat was most preferred. P. pygmaeus in both sites preferred riparian habitat, then meadow and forest least of all. The foraging activity of soprano pipistrelles was higher in birch than in coniferous woodland, whereas for the common pipistrelle, it was more evenly distributed. In both sites the lowest number of feeding buzzes was recorded in dense forest. In both study areas social calls were recorded, but many more for P. pygmaeus than for P. pipistrellus, especially in birch woodland. Soprano pipistrelle is a specialist species, focused mostly on riparian habitat, whereas common pipistrelle shows more generalistic behaviour.

Watsonia			Rubus trelleckensis is a rare endemic bramble found only in one 10-km square near Trelleck, Gwent (v.c. 35), Wales. It is a perennial which flowers from mid-July to mid-August, and sets abundant fruit but probably does not spread vegetatively. A field survey was carried out in 1998. Five small populations were found, all in locations which were probably at one time either open heath or open birch-oak woodland but are now either conifer plantation, or conifers mixed with broadleaved trees. Plants were most frequent on acidic podzols in sunny but sheltered spots on level ground. The main threats to its survival are change of land-use from forestry or changes in forestry operations. Seeds have been deposited in the Millennium Seed Bank at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Wakehurst Place.	23	2	317-322	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	1998	Not reported	Wales	Beacon Hill	51.7456252	-2.707951435	Identify presence of Rubus trelleckensis across different land use types	Pairwise comparison landuse	Stratified	1	Oak	Broadleaf woodland;Conifer woodland;Forest plantation	Not reported	Not reported	Clear-cut	Mid-rotation;Prethicket & Thicket	Not reported	Broadleaf woodland	Morphology	In 1998 the available information was collated, combined with a field survey, to establish its current status and determine its needs for conservation.

The relative performance of smooth snakes inhabiting open heathland and conifer plantations	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/j.foreco.2018.06.020	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048827919&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2018.06.020&partnerID=40&md5=a9f4e155c1b70c2168534094983e4952	Different habitat types that support similar densities of a particular species may not be equally suitable for that species and this may impact on the ability of that species to grow, reproduce, and survive. Here we investigate the impact of habitat quality on the performance of the UK's rarest snake which inhabits both lowland heath and adjacent areas of managed conifer plantation located on former lowland heath. Annually, over an 8 year period (2009â€“2016), we recaptured known individual smooth snakes (Coronella austriaca) in these two habitat types and compared their survivorship, using Program MARK, and growth rates, estimated ages, reproductive outputs, emigration/immigration, and body condition, using regression analysis and GLM. When compared with snakes from plantations those inhabiting open heathland had higher growth rates, were larger for any given age, had a higher body condition and females produced more embryos for a given body size. Smooth snake survivorship rates within the two habitats were similar. Whilst the body condition of snakes in heathland did not change during the study it declined in plantations and this decline was correlated with increasing plantation age and tree canopy cover. Our data show that although smooth snakes occur in both habitat types the overall quality of open heathland is superior to that of plantations, particularly in the long term. This study has potentially important implications for the conservation of smooth snakes and other reptile and vertebrate species inhabiting coniferous plantations, where management practices aimed at reducing ground vegetation cover, such as cattle grazing and the use of herbicides, are also used. The combination of increasing canopy cover and these additional ground vegetation control measures are likely to significantly reduce further the time period over which plantations can be utilised by these taxa.

Native woodland creation is associated with increase in a Black Grouse Lyrurus tetrix population	Bird Study	10.1080/00063657.2016.1273879		Capsule: Black Grouse population increases were greatest where new native woodland (NNW) within 1500m of leks comprised approximately 30% of land area and averaged 5 years old.Aims: To examine whether change in a population of Black Grouse Lyrurus tetrix in Scotland was associated with the creation of native woodland.Methods: We examined whether lek location, size and change in size were associated with habitat and topography surrounding leks. We also examined vegetation differences in NNW and adjacent unplanted moorland.Results: From 2002 to 2012 the number of lekking male Black Grouse increased by 90%. Lek occurrence was positively associated with the amount of NNW edge habitat. Leks were larger where there was more adjacent NNW. Lek increases were greatest where NNW plots comprised approximately 30% land area, and were 5 years old, within a 1500m radius. Plots aged more than approximately 20 years old were associated with Black Grouse population declines. NNW supported taller and denser important field-layer vegetation than adjacent moorland, likely due to grazing exclusion.Conclusions: Subject to longer-term management commitments to stimulate continued regrowth of the important field layer and maintain benefits for Black Grouse, expansion of native woodland could contribute to landscape-scale recovery of Black Grouse after decades of decline.	64	1	70-83	Yes	Managed	Landscape	1	2002	120	Scotland	Tayside	56.734696	-3.8525534	To examine whether change in a population of Black Grouse Lyrurus tetrix in Scotland was associated with the creation of native woodland.

The impacts of conifer afforestation and climate on water quality and freshwater ecology in a sensitive peaty catchment: A 25 year study in the upper River Halladale in North Scotland	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119616	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115970671&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2021.119616&partnerID=40&md5=679113c09caa97bf7d9737026bd3d6c5	Our study was driven by objections to afforesting the sensitive peaty headwaters of the River Halladale in Northern Scotland on the grounds that this would damage water quality and the local salmon fishery. Approval was given in 1995 for the planting to proceed on condition that monitoring was carried out to assess the effects of forest establishment and growth on water quality and ecology. The long-term data also allowed us to study the effects of climate on water quality. Stream turbidity, colour and DOC levels were unaffected by ploughing and drainage that preceded tree planting in 1996, indicating that good forestry practice measures were effective in limiting soil disturbance and transport of mobilised sediment to the watercourses. Nitrate and ammonium concentrations remained low following afforestation but Total P increased in response to a series of fertiliser applications over the proceeding 20 years. These increases were temporary and have had no impact on river ecological status; calculated phosphorus fluxes were low. Concerns over the potential for afforestation to increase surface water acidification were not borne out, even in the most acid-sensitive tributary. None of the acidity parameters increased over the course of the study and conditions in all watercourses remained suitable for supporting salmonid fish. Decreasing SO4 concentrations indicate an improvement in water quality due to reduced sulphur deposition, with no evidence of any afforestation or forest scavenging effect. Significant changes in streamwater acidity were seen after two hurricanes in winter 2011/12. Two sites showed a marked reduction in stream pH and aluminium, and a marked rise in Acid Neutralising Capacity (ANC), that lasted for a period of at least four years. These changes accorded with notable rises in base cation concentrations and turbidity, suggesting a temporary increase in mineral weathering, most likely caused by a localised land slip or bank collapse. Sea-salt inputs and soil ion-exchange reactions are also thought to have affected the response in streamwater chemistry. The water quality results correspond well with data from the fish and benthic invertebrate surveys, which showed that forestry operations and forest growth to age 24 years have had no adverse impact on population diversity or abundance with no evidence of deterioration in freshwater ecology over the time series. These findings will help inform future woodland expansion for multiple benefits, including within sensitive water catchments.

The European Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus is a species of conservation concern across Europe due to population depletion through habitat loss. Pine plantation-forest is now a key Nightjar nesting habitat, particularly in northwestern Europe, and increased understanding of foraging habitat selection is required. We radiotracked 31 Nightjars in an extensive (185-km(2)) complex conifer plantation landscape in 2009 and 2010. Home-range 95% kernels for females, paired males and unpaired males were an order of magnitude larger than song territories of paired males, emphasizing the importance of habitats beyond the song territory. Nightjars travelled a mean maximum distance of 747m from the territory centre each night. Home-range placement relative to landscape composition was examined by compositional analysis. Pre-closure canopy forest (aged 5-10years) was selected at all scales (MCP, 95% and 50% kernels), with newly planted forest (aged 0-4years) also selected within 50% kernels. For telemetry fixes relative to habitat composition within 2km of their territory centre, individuals again selected pre-closure and newly planted forest, and also grazed grass heath. Open ungrazed habitat was not selected, with implications for open habitat planning for biodiversity conservation within public-owned forests. Despite the Nightjars' selection for younger growth, moth biomass was greater in older forest stands, suggesting that foraging site selection reflects ease of prey capture rather than prey abundance. Within large plantation-forest landscapes, a variety of growth stages is important for this species and our results suggest that grazing of open habitats within and adjacent to forest will additionally benefit the European Nightjar.	157	2	260-272	No	Not applicable 	Forest	1	2009	12	England	Thetford Forest	52.429319	0.72390593	To examine the home-range extent of females, paired males and unpaired males, distances travelled, and habitat use within the landscape.

From this, the UK and Isle of Man breeding population was estimated at 570 territorial pairs: 436 in Scotland, 19 in England, 28 in Wales, 38 in Northern Ireland and 49 on the Isle of Man. Although there was no overall change in the size of the UK and Isle of Man population between 1988â€“94 and 1998, numbers declined in Orkney and increased in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, numbers increased on grouse moors and decreased in young plantation between 1988â€“89 and 1998, so that 55% of the population is now found on grouse moor. A similar situation exists in England, but in Northern Ireland 45% of the population was found breeding in open areas within mature conifer plantations in 1998.

Management interventions that aim to maximise FD require knowledge of multiple environmental drivers of FD, which have not been studied to date in temperate coniferous production forests. We quantified the relative importance of abiotic (forest management) and biotic (ground vegetation community) drivers of carabid FD and trait distribution in 44 coniferous plantation forest stands across the UK. Carabid FD declined with canopy cover and carabid body length correlated negatively with the percentage of open semi-natural area surrounding a plot. We conclude that forest management could enhance carabid FD through initiatives that emulate natural disturbance regimes through gap creation. We found that neither functional nor taxonomic metrics of vegetation diversity correlated with carabid FD, suggesting that restoration of plant communities, a major goal of forest restoration efforts, will not necessarily enhance carabid FD in coniferous plantations.

Similar biodiversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in set-aside plantations and ancient old-growth broadleaved forests	Biological Conservation			Setting aside overmature planted forests is currently seen as an option for preserving species associated with old- growth forests, such as those with dispersal limitation. Few data exist, however, on the utility of set-aside plan- tations for this purpose, or the value of this habitat type for biodiversity relative to old-growth semi-natural eco- systems. Here, we evaluate the contribution of forest type relative to habitat characteristics in determining species richness and composition in seven forest blocks, each containing an ancient old-growth stand (N1000 yrs) paired with a set-aside even-aged planted stand (ca. 180 yrs). We investigated the functionally im- portant yet relatively neglected ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), a group for which the importance of forest age has not been assessed in broadleaved forests. We found that forest type was not an important determinant of EMF species richness or composition, demonstrating that set-aside can be an effective option for conserving ancient EMF communities. Species richness of above-ground EMF fruiting bodies was principally related to the basal area of the stand (a correlate of canopy cover) and tree species diversity, whilst richness of below-ground ectomycorrhizae was driven only by tree diversity. Our results suggest that overmature planted forest stands, particularly those that are mixed-woods with high basal area, are an effective means to connect and expand ecological networks of ancient old-growth forests in historically deforested and fragmented landscapes for ectomycorrhizal fungi.	194		71-79	Yes	Managed	Stand	7	2012	36	England	New Forest	50.857679	-1.617773	The aims of this study were to (1) compare EMF biodiversity and species associations amongst overmature planted and ancient old-growth forest stands; and (2) de- termine what stand characteristics explain the differences in species richness and composition in order to identify opportunities for enhanc- ing EMF diversity in overmature planted stands.

These stands are considered to be poor in terms of general biodiversity and vulnerable to outbreaks of insect pests and diseases. In contrast, stands managed using alternative silvicultural systems, such as shelterwood or group selection systems, contain a wider range of tree ages and sizes and have the potential to support greater numbers of other species. If this includes the natural enemies (predators, parasitoids) of pest species, then adopting alternative silvicultural systems might help to reduce current and future pest impacts. To determine whether the greater structural complexity of stands managed using alternative silvicultural systems is associated with an increase in insect diversity and an increase in the abundance of predatory species, we sampled hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) in 5 shelterwood stands, 6 group selection stands and 13 even-aged stands of Sitka spruce at 4 forest sites in mid and north Wales. The larvae of aphidophagous hoverflies are important invertebrate predators in spruce plantations, and hoverfly species richness is often used as an indicator of general invertebrate diversity. Hoverflies were sampled at ground level and in the canopy using yellow pan traps and flight interception traps. 7323 adult hoverflies of 74 species were captured, the majority of these in traps in the canopy. Total hoverfly abundance and the abundance of aphidophagous species were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in group selection stands. The lowest abundance was recorded in even-aged stands, but patterns in abundance amongst the even-aged stands depended on whether sampling was carried out near the ground or in the canopy. Traps at ground level caught significantly fewer hoverflies in mid-rotation even-aged stands, whereas traps in the canopy caught similar, if not more, hoverflies in mid-rotation stands compared with young and mature even-aged stands. Stand species richness was closely related to the total numbers of individuals captured (abundance) and as a result was also highest in group selection stands, but there was no fundamental difference in hoverfly diversity (Hâ€™) between stand types or silvicultural systems. The data indicate that unlike abundance, overall hoverfly diversity was determined at a wider landscape scale and, at the plot scale, there was no evidence that structurally complex spruce stands supported more species because they provided a wider range of microhabitats and ecological niches.

Total hoverfly abundance and the abundance of aphidophagous species were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in group selection stands. The lowest abundance was recorded in even-aged stands, but patterns in abundance amongst the even-aged stands depended on whether sampling was carried out near the ground or in the canopy. Traps at ground level caught significantly fewer hoverflies in mid-rotation even-aged stands, whereas traps in the canopy caught similar, if not more, hoverflies in mid-rotation stands compared with young and mature even-aged stands. Stand species richness was closely related to the total numbers of individuals captured (abundance) and as a result was also highest in group selection stands, but there was no fundamental difference in hoverfly diversity (Hâ€™) between stand types or silvicultural systems. The data indicate that unlike abundance, overall hoverfly diversity was determined at a wider landscape scale and, at the plot scale, there was no evidence that structurally complex spruce stands supported more species because they provided a wider range of microhabitats and ecological niches.

The influence of forest management on the abundance and diversity of hoverflies in commercial plantations of Sitka spruce: the importance of sampling in the canopy	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/j.foreco.2017.06.010	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032855647&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2017.06.010&partnerID=40&md5=c7180a46a9a2047fc695613ee8adcae5	The majority of Sitka spruce plantations in the UK are managed by clear-cutting and replanting, which leads to the formation of relatively large blocks (5â€“30 ha) of even-aged, closely spaced trees. These stands are considered to be poor in terms of general biodiversity and vulnerable to outbreaks of insect pests and diseases. In contrast, stands managed using alternative silvicultural systems, such as shelterwood or group selection systems, contain a wider range of tree ages and sizes and have the potential to support greater numbers of other species. If this includes the natural enemies (predators, parasitoids) of pest species, then adopting alternative silvicultural systems might help to reduce current and future pest impacts. To determine whether the greater structural complexity of stands managed using alternative silvicultural systems is associated with an increase in insect diversity and an increase in the abundance of predatory species, we sampled hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) in 5 shelterwood stands, 6 group selection stands and 13 even-aged stands of Sitka spruce at 4 forest sites in mid and north Wales. The larvae of aphidophagous hoverflies are important invertebrate predators in spruce plantations, and hoverfly species richness is often used as an indicator of general invertebrate diversity. Hoverflies were sampled at ground level and in the canopy using yellow pan traps and flight interception traps. 7323 adult hoverflies of 74 species were captured, the majority of these in traps in the canopy.

Durham. Fewer Golden Plover and Dunlin were seen close to plantations than further away. The total number of wader sightings (i.e. Golden Plover, Dunlin, Redshank, Curlew, Lapwing, Snipe, Greenshank and Common Sandpiper combined) followed the same pattern. For Golden Plover and all waders combined, the effect extended up to 400 m from the forestry edge. For Dunlin the effect extended beyond 400 mfrom the forest edge. On a subset of 5 sites, there was no evidence for vegetation changes which might account for these patterns. However, this failure to detect changes in the vegetation may be due to the methods used. Comparisons are made with earlier studies, and possible mechanisms are discussed. Changes in bird numbers with distance from the forest edge could be due to the way sites are selected for forestry, or due to â€˜edge effectsâ€™. A study suggesting that map-derived variables, which could have been influenced by afforestation, change with distance from the forest edge is consistent with the first of these hypotheses. Studies suggesting changes in vegetation, in association with afforestation, are consistent with the second. Further research is necessary to investigate the relative importance of these 2 possible mechanisms. This research should be carried out before further forestry developments near important areas for nature conservation.

The distribution of wood-ants (Formica lugubris Zetterstedt) in a northern English forest.	Ecological Entomology	10.1111/j.1365-2311.1977.tb00895.x		A survey of 202 ha of planted forest in northern England in 1972 disclosed 326 occupied and 38 deserted nests of Formica lugubris Zett. Nests were associated with most crop trees and wild trees present, but were most abundant near to plantation margins and regenerating natural scrub. In planted areas, 76% of nests were found 5 m or less from the plantation boundary. More nests were found on the south and west borders than on the north and east borders, respectively, and most nests were not shaded from the south or south-east. An analysis of nearest-neighbour measurements showed that the distribution was clumped. Nest mounds were higher in shaded than in unshaded situations. The diameter of nest mounds was greater in areas planted with trees before 1945 than for more recent ones. It is suggested that the present population of F. lugubris appears to have spread from nests present in marginal natural woodland that escaped the disturbance of the area at the time of planting. It is further suggested that if nests were transplanted into areas at present free from ants, for the biological control of defoliating Lepidoptera, it would be necessary to provide rides or clearings at intervals of about 40 m to establish the ants at a high even density.	2	4	301-313	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1972	Not reported	England	Broxa;Silpho;Suffield Moor	54.31333358	-0.5492614739	The object of the survey was partly to find suit- able areas for other investigations, and partly to characterize those parts of the forest favoured by ants! and to see whether ant-free areas existed which ants might subsequently colonize or to .which they might be trans- planted	Pairwise comparison landuse	Randomised & blocked	364	Corsican pine	Heathland	Single Age, Single Storey	Monoculture	Not reported		Not reported	Heathland;Pasture	Morphology	When a new nest was discovered the team completed a four-page record form, on which the nest was allotted a serial number.

The distribution of wood-ants (Formica lugubris Zetterstedt) in a northern English forest.	Ecological Entomology	10.1111/j.1365-2311.1977.tb00895.x		A survey of 202 ha of planted forest in northern England in 1972 disclosed 326 occupied and 38 deserted nests of Formica lugubris Zett. Nests were associated with most crop trees and wild trees present, but were most abundant near to plantation margins and regenerating natural scrub. In planted areas, 76% of nests were found 5 m or less from the plantation boundary. More nests were found on the south and west borders than on the north and east borders, respectively, and most nests were not shaded from the south or south-east. An analysis of nearest-neighbour measurements showed that the distribution was clumped. Nest mounds were higher in shaded than in unshaded situations. The diameter of nest mounds was greater in areas planted with trees before 1945 than for more recent ones. It is suggested that the present population of F. lugubris appears to have spread from nests present in marginal natural woodland that escaped the disturbance of the area at the time of planting. It is further suggested that if nests were transplanted into areas at present free from ants, for the biological control of defoliating Lepidoptera, it would be necessary to provide rides or clearings at intervals of about 40 m to establish the ants at a high even density.	2	4	301-313	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1972	Not reported	England	Broxa;Silpho;Suffield Moor	54.31931876	-0.5153143767	The object of the survey was partly to find suit- able areas for other investigations, and partly to characterize those parts of the forest favoured by ants! and to see whether ant-free areas existed which ants might subsequently colonize or to .which they might be trans- planted	Pairwise comparison landuse	Randomised & blocked	364	Scots pine	Heathland	Single Age, Single Storey	Monoculture	Not reported		Not reported	Heathland;Pasture	Morphology	When a new nest was discovered the team completed a four-page record form, on which the nest was allotted a serial number.

The distribution of wood-ants (Formica lugubris Zetterstedt) in a northern English forest.	Ecological Entomology	10.1111/j.1365-2311.1977.tb00895.x		A survey of 202 ha of planted forest in northern England in 1972 disclosed 326 occupied and 38 deserted nests of Formica lugubris Zett. Nests were associated with most crop trees and wild trees present, but were most abundant near to plantation margins and regenerating natural scrub. In planted areas, 76% of nests were found 5 m or less from the plantation boundary. More nests were found on the south and west borders than on the north and east borders, respectively, and most nests were not shaded from the south or south-east. An analysis of nearest-neighbour measurements showed that the distribution was clumped. Nest mounds were higher in shaded than in unshaded situations. The diameter of nest mounds was greater in areas planted with trees before 1945 than for more recent ones.

It is suggested that the present population of F. lugubris appears to have spread from nests present in marginal natural woodland that escaped the disturbance of the area at the time of planting. It is further suggested that if nests were transplanted into areas at present free from ants, for the biological control of defoliating Lepidoptera, it would be necessary to provide rides or clearings at intervals of about 40 m to establish the ants at a high even density.	2	4	301-313	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1972	Not reported	England	Broxa;Silpho;Suffield Moor	54.3068013	-0.4905951384	The object of the survey was partly to find suit- able areas for other investigations, and partly to characterize those parts of the forest favoured by ants! and to see whether ant-free areas existed which ants might subsequently colonize or to .which they might be trans- planted	Pairwise comparison tree species	Randomised & blocked	364	Corsican pine	Heathland	Single Age, Single Storey	Monoculture	Not reported		Not reported	Heathland;Pasture	Morphology	When a new nest was discovered the team completed a four-page record form, on which the nest was allotted a serial number.

These represent a population of 5600?7900 birds after adjustment for incomplete counts of group sizes. Mean group densities were about ten times higher in ancient native pinewoods (9.0?10.3 km?2) than in other woodlands (0.7?1.3km?2) which comprised largely planted Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine and Sitka Spruce. Thus, 35% of the Scottish population of Crested Tits occurred in ancient native pinewood, which comprises only 4.7% of the woodland. Crested Tits were associated mainly with Scots Pine, but were also seen in Lodgepole Pine, Norway Spruce, larch, Rowan, Alder and birch. The group densities within the stands of Scots Pines in ancient native pinewoods were 10.4?12.3 km?2 and 1.2?2.4 km?2 in Scots Pines in other woodlands. Within ancient native pinewoods, they preferred stands with a high proportion of Scots Pines, and particularly those with older trees. In other woodlands, there was again a preference for stands with a high proportion of Scots Pines, and Heather was also selected.

Thus, 35% of the Scottish population of Crested Tits occurred in ancient native pinewood, which comprises only 4.7% of the woodland. Crested Tits were associated mainly with Scots Pine, but were also seen in Lodgepole Pine, Norway Spruce, larch, Rowan, Alder and birch. The group densities within the stands of Scots Pines in ancient native pinewoods were 10.4?12.3 km?2 and 1.2?2.4 km?2 in Scots Pines in other woodlands. Within ancient native pinewoods, they preferred stands with a high proportion of Scots Pines, and particularly those with older trees. In other woodlands, there was again a preference for stands with a high proportion of Scots Pines, and Heather was also selected. Crested Tits will continue to benefit from the planting of Scots Pines, and if the woods develop a Heather field layer. However, they will not benefit from spruce plantations.

Ibis, 149, pp.175-182.	2007	Summers, RW	Stand selection by birds in Scots pinewoods in Scotland: the need for more old-growth pinewood	Ibis	10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00730.x		A study at Abernethy Forest, Scotland, examined stand selection by some of the birds of conservation concern that inhabit pinewoods. Abernethy Forest was ideally suited for the study because all four main stand types of forest development (stand initiation, stem exclusion, understorey reinitiation and old-growth) were represented. Capercaillies Tetrao urogallus (both males and females) and crossbills Loxia pp. preferred old-growth pinewood in winter, and Redstarts Phoenicurus phoenicurus and Tree Pipits Anthus trivialis preferred old-growth in summer. Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major selected snags in old-growth to excavate nest and roost sites. In winter, Crested Tits Parus cristatus had a weak selection for old-growth stands and Bullfinches Pyrrhula pyrrhula preferred stands at initiation. Possible reasons for these preferences are put forward. Although the area of conifer woodland in Scotland is 888 000 ha, it largely comprises North American species destined to be cut before reaching old-growth. Old-growth pinewood in Scotland is largely confined to the fragments of ancient native pinewood, amounting to only 16 000 ha. To conserve some pinewood birds of conservation concern, a mechanism to allow more Scots Pine Pinus sylvestris woods to reach and remain in an old-growth state needs to be pursued.	149		175-182	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	2002	60	Scotland	Abernethy Forest	57.25	-3.6666667	In this paper, stand preferences of birds of conservation concern in Scots Pine wood- land are described, and then habitat attributes are examined at a finer scale to try to explain the habitat association.

Habitat associations of Scottish crossbills and common crossbills Loxia curvirostra were determined from a systematic survey of conifer woodland within the range of the Scottish crossbill during January to April 2008. All the commonly planted conifers were producing cones. Scottish crossbills were associated with the amount of coning lodgepole pine Pinus contorta, whilst common crossbills were associated with coning Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis, lodgepole pine and to a small extent with larches Larix spp. The Scottish crossbill's association with lodgepole pine is interesting in view of the notion that Scottish crossbills are adapted to Scots pine Pinus sylvestris. Likewise, there was no evidence that common crossbills in the study area during January to April 2008 had an association with Norway spruce Picea abies, the tree with which they are normally associated in continental Europe. Lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce cones have thinner scales than those of Scots pine and Norway spruce, respectively, so are probably easier to exploit for seeds than the conifers to which they are assumed to be adapted. This may explain the associations we found. North American crossbills that specialise on lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce have smaller bills than even common crossbills (the smallest of the western Palearctic crossbills, apart from the two-barred crossbill Loxia leucoptera bifasciata). Adaptation to Sitka spruce by common crossbills is unlikely because common crossbills in Scotland largely arrive during irruptions from continental Europe, after which they return in a subsequent season. Therefore, their association with North American conifers in Scotland is temporary. For the resident Scottish crossbills, there is a greater possibility of adaptation to lodgepole pine. However, given the difficulties in identification of old specimens in museums, it was not possible to examine trends in bill size; the prediction is that bill size should decline. Future research needs to distinguish which conifer Scottish crossbills are adapted to as opposed to those which may be temporarily preferred when most profitable.

Scottish crossbills were associated with the amount of coning lodgepole pine Pinus contorta, whilst common crossbills were associated with coning Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis, lodgepole pine and to a small extent with larches Larix spp. The Scottish crossbill's association with lodgepole pine is interesting in view of the notion that Scottish crossbills are adapted to Scots pine Pinus sylvestris. Likewise, there was no evidence that common crossbills in the study area during January to April 2008 had an association with Norway spruce Picea abies, the tree with which they are normally associated in continental Europe. Lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce cones have thinner scales than those of Scots pine and Norway spruce, respectively, so are probably easier to exploit for seeds than the conifers to which they are assumed to be adapted. This may explain the associations we found. North American crossbills that specialise on lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce have smaller bills than even common crossbills (the smallest of the western Palearctic crossbills, apart from the two-barred crossbill Loxia leucoptera bifasciata). Adaptation to Sitka spruce by common crossbills is unlikely because common crossbills in Scotland largely arrive during irruptions from continental Europe, after which they return in a subsequent season. Therefore, their association with North American conifers in Scotland is temporary. For the resident Scottish crossbills, there is a greater possibility of adaptation to lodgepole pine. However, given the difficulties in identification of old specimens in museums, it was not possible to examine trends in bill size; the prediction is that bill size should decline. Future research needs to distinguish which conifer Scottish crossbills are adapted to as opposed to those which may be temporarily preferred when most profitable.

Both pine and oak form ectomycorrhizas that cover their roots and extend into the soil, facilitating tree water and nutrient uptake in exchange for photosynthetic carbon. Forming the interface between the soil and tree roots, mycorrhizal fungi are key drivers of biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and play an important role in the successful establishment of tree seedlings. They can, however, be susceptible to changes in the soil environment and in their hosts. Both environment and neighboring hosts affect how fungi colonize roots and may affect their host preference. Despite the importance of mycorrhizal fungi in forest ecosystems, little is known about the biodiversity and functional effects of mycorrhizal communities in mixed compared with monoculture plantations. Changes in mycorrhizal richness and composition can result in changes in functional groups with consequences for forest ecosystem stability and functioning. We compared pine mycorrhizas in eight mixed plantations of pine and oak and eight pine monocultures in two forests in England, and we investigated the main factors driving their taxonomic and functional composition. Geographical location and litter pH explained over 50% of the variation in pine mycorrhizal communities. Different environmental factors affected taxonomic and functional composition across stands, indicating functional redundancy. Pine tended to associate with more fungi in the presence of oak, but the abiotic environment exerted a stronger influence than oak presence on pine mycorrhizal diversity.

Breeding numbers and stand type preferences of Redstarts Phoenicurus phoenicurus and Tree Pipits Anthus trivialis in a Scots Pine Pinus sylvestris wood.	Bird Study	10.1080/00063650802681714	http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a909822189	Capsule: Old-growth stands within an ancient native pinewood in Scotland provide an important habitat for both species. Aims: To obtain estimates of densities and total numbers of male Redstarts and Tree Pipits in a native pinewood, and to describe forest stand type preferences. Methods: Singing males were recorded along transects in Abernethy Forest, comprising ancient native pinewood and Scots Pine plantations, to estimate densities and numbers (by distance sampling), and to assess stand type selection (using Manly and Jacobs' indices). A check was made to ensure that singing was sustained throughout the survey period. Results: The density and total numbers for Redstarts were 7.6 males per km2 (95% CL 5.8-10.1) and 290 males (95% CL 220-380). For Tree Pipits, there were 7.3 males per km2 (5.5-9.8) and 275 males (210-370). Higher densities occurred in the stands of preferred old-growth woodland: 15.1 Redstart males per km2 (95% CL 10.7-21.3) and 15.6 Tree Pipit males per km2 (95% CL 10.6-22.9). Redstarts selected stands of high crown trees, mature open and old open woodland and bog pines. Tree Pipits selected stands of high crown trees and old open woodland. Conclusion: The old-growth stands of Scots Pine were preferred by Redstarts and Tree Pipits. This study supports the current management to protect and expand such stands within Abernethy Forest, but more old-growth woodland is required elsewhere in Scotland.	56	1	120-126	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	2005	2	Scotland	Abernethy Forest	57.25	-3.6666667	This study aims to inform forest management by providing baseline population data for each species in the largest ancient native pinewood in Scotland (Abernethy Forest)	Pairwise comparison chronosequence	Stratified	17	Scots pine	Ancient woodland;Forest plantation	Single Age, Single Storey	Monoculture	Clear-cut	Mature;Mid-rotation;Prethicket & Thicket	Not reported	Not applicable	Morphology	Distance analysis assumes that all birds on the transect line are detected	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	No	Entire habitat	Anthus trivialis;Phoenicurus phoenicurus					Birds	No	Not applicable	No	No

The acoustic diversity of a soundscape can be indicative of the richness of an acoustic community and the structural/vegetation characteristics of a habitat. There is a need to apply these methods to landscapes that are ecologically and/or economically important. We investigate the relationship between the acoustic properties of a coniferous forest with stand-age and structure. We sampled a 73 point grid in part of the UKâ€™s largest man-made lowland coniferous plantation forest, covering a 320ha mosaic of different aged stands. Forest stands ranged from 0â€“85 years old providing an age-gradient. Short soundscape recordings were collected from each grid point on multiple mornings (between 6am-11am) to capture the dawn chorus. We repeated the study during July/August in 2014 and again in 2015. Five acoustic indices were calculated for a total of 889 two minute samples. Moderate relationships between acoustic diversity with forest stand-age and vegetation characteristics (canopy height; canopy cover) were observed. Ordinations suggest that as structural complexity and forest age increases, the higher frequency bands (4-10KHz) become more represented in the soundscape. A strong linear relationship was observed between distance to the nearest road and the ratio of anthropogenic noise to biological sounds within the soundscape. Similar acoustic patterns were observed in both years, though acoustic diversity was generally lower in 2014, which was likely due to differences in wind conditions between years. Our results suggest that developing these relatively low-cost acoustic monitoring methods to inform adaptive management of production landscapes, may lead to improved biodiversity monitoring. The methods may also prove useful for modelling road noise, landscape planning and noise mitigation. Â© 2018 Turner et al.

Scale-specific correlations between habitat heterogeneity and soil fauna diversity along a landscape structure gradient. 	Oecologia			Habitat heterogeneity contributes to the maintenance of diversity, but the extent that landscape-scale rather than local-scale heterogeneity inXuences the diversity of soil invertebrates—species with small range sizes—is less clear. Using a Scottish habitat heterogeneity gradient we correlated Collembola and lumbricid worm species richness and abundance with diVerent elements (forest cover, habitat richness and patchiness) and qualities (plant species richness, soil variables) of habitat heterogeneity, at landscape (1 km2 ) and local (up to 200 m2 ) scales. Soil fauna assemblages showed considerable turnover in species composition along this habitat heterogeneity gradient. Soil fauna species richness and turnover was greatest in landscapes that were a mosaic of habitats. Soil fauna diversity was hump-shaped along a gradient of forest cover, peaking where there was a mixture of forest and open habitats in the landscape. Landscape-scale habitat richness was positively correlated with lumbricid diversity, while Collembola and lumbricid abundances were negatively and positively related to landscape spatial patchiness. Furthermore, soil fauna diversity was positively correlated with plant diversity, which in turn peaked in the sites that were a mosaic of forest and open habitat patches. There was less evidence that local-scale habitat variables (habitat richness, tree cover, plant species richness, litter cover, soil pH, depth of organic horizon) aVected soil fauna diversity: Collembola diversity was independent of all these measures, while lumbricid diversity positively and negatively correlated with Vascular plants species richness and tree canopy density.

Birch in spruce plantations–management for biodiversity			The ground flora under pure spruce stands was compared w ith that of stands of spruce /birch mixtures and pure birch thickets. The vegetation of these managed stands was compared with that of unm anaged birch and sem i-natural w oodland within the forest estate. The retention of birch within the managed spruce crop enhances cover and diversity of the ground flora in first and subsequent rotation stands. The response of the ground flora was closely related to the density of birch; thickets supported consistently higher cover and diversity of species than mixtures or pure spruce. There were significant differences between the flora of managed birch thickets compared to unmanaged birch within the forest estate. These differences are apparent in the cover of different components of the ground vegetation and in their species composition. Forbs in managed stands have low cover and diversity compared to unmanaged birch while bryophyte cover and diversity are inflated in the m anaged thickets. Floristic differences betw een biogeographical regions were retained in m anaged thickets but lost in pure spruce. Few er vegetation com m unities were recognised in the m anaged birch; the greatest number being in the thickets with the lowest in the pure spruce. The species composition of recognised communities in managed birch deviated from that of their unmanaged counterparts; many species (especially forbs) were m issing w hile others (notably bryophytes) were over-represented. Retention of birch to m axim ise vegetation biodiversity should concentrate primarily on those areas of unmanaged birch within the forest estate and secondarily on the thickets within the managed crop.			13-24	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	1991	24	Scotland	Central Highlands, Western Mainland, Southern Isles, Southern Lowland and Coast, and Southern Uplands	NA		The response of the ground flora to the presence of birch was examined using criteria of species cover and diversity; the extent to which 13 these responses influenced the developm ent of vegetation associations within the plantations was also considered.

Birch in Spruce Plantations, p.42.	1998	Barbour, D.A., Watt, A.B., McBeath, C.	The diversity and larval feeding status of moths in spruce forests	Management for Biodiversity			Lepidoptera, being wholly phytophagous and a rel- atively well-known group, were chosen for detailed investigation into species diversity and larval feed- ing status within spruce forests. Species diversity of light-trapped Lepidoptera (measured by log-series alpha) increased with proportion of birch in both the young-spruce and the older-spruce plot series, and was highest of all in semi-natural birchwood plots. However, in older-spruce plots the diversity only increased rather weakly with proportion of birch; in young-spruce plots the proportional increase was stronger. M oth catches were scored for 'birch-feeding status' according to known feeding preferences of the larvae. Specialist birch-feeding species increased with proportion of birch in both young-spruce and older-spruce plots. Generalist birch-feeding species (those with other foodplants in addition to birch) showed no increasing trend with proportion of birch. Specialist birch-feeding species were further found to fall into two cate- gories: those that increased in simple proportion to the amount of birch in plots, and those that occurred almost exclusively in natural birchwood, rarely or never in the birch/spruce mixtures. Several nation- ally notable species were caught in small numbers, most in the natural birchwood plots and fewest in the spruce plots with no birch.

The abundance, diversity and management of arthropods in spruce forests. 	Management for Biodiversity			The abundance and diversity of arthropods was sam pled w ithin three Scottish spruce forests: Dalbeattie, M oray and Knapdale. At each study site, sampling was carried out in 7-8 plots of spruce with varying amounts of birch (approximately 0%, 5%, 30% and 100% birch in old and young spruce), a semi-natural birchwood, a clearfell plot, and a plot in nearby grassland or moorland. Approximately 800 000 insects and other arthropods were collected in M alaise traps. The abundance of Diptera, Hymenoptera and most other groups of arthropods were as great or greater in spruce plantations as in nearby birchw oods. Only H em iptera and Coleoptera (beetles) were more abundant in the birchwood plots than in the spruce plantation plots. Coleoptera and Hemiptera increased significantly in abundance as the amount of birch in a plot increased. No other arthropod group was affected by the amount of birch in a plot except Syrphidae (hoverflies) which declined in terms of percentage abundance as the am ount of birch in a plot increased. Over 3500 hoverflies were collected from Malaise traps and identified to species. A total of 70 species were recorded. M any of the hoverfly species found were either locally uncommon or nationally notable. The species diversity of hoverflies w as particularly low in the natural birchw ood plots. A lm ost 3900 beetles were collected in pitfall traps and identified to species. A total of 185 carabid, staphylinid and other beetle species were recorded, 7 of which are classified as nationally notable. The largest num bers of Carabidae were caught in the natural birchwood and the clearfell plots. Carabid species diversity was generally low and did not vary greatly between plots either with or without birch. The highest individual num bers, but low est diversity, of Staphylinidae were trapped in the birchwood plots. The birchw ood Staphylinidae were heavily dominated by a small number of characteristic species largely absent from the other plots. In conclusion, even low percentages of birch mixed within compartments of spruce are beneficial to many arthropod groups. However, since the best habitat for insects associated with birch is seminatural birchwood, the few areas of mature birch that exist within spruce plantations should be given full protection, and areas of younger birch within spruce plantations should be protected and enlarged so that they become birchwoods rich in arthropods in the future.			31-44	Yes	Managed	Forest	1	1993	15	Scotland	Dalbeattie;Knapdale;Moray	54.93518362	-3.822766235	To compare the abundance and diversity of arthropods in natural birchwoods with that found in spruce plantations.

Aims: To inform Black Grouse conservation programmes in southern Scotland we quantified recent trends in numbers, assessed habitat composition within lek ranges and evaluated the size of suitable habitat patches. Methods: We explored trends in numbers of males at 121 leks surveyed between 1989 and 2018 in southwest and southeast Scotland. Wider surveys of males attending leks between 2006-12 were used to measure habitat composition within lek ranges and to compare with that in the study areas. Numbers of males at leks were considered in relation to habitat types and moorland management categories. Occupancy of moorland habitat patches was explored in relation to their size, connectivity and gamekeeping activity. Results: Abundance at a sample of 121 leks surveyed between 1989-99 and 2017-18 fell from 70 males to zero in the southwest and from 340 to 44 in the southeast, with 82% of leks no longer occupied. Retained leks had more acid and rough grassland (53%) and less conifer cover (6%) within a 1 km radius than extinct leks (32% and 29%) and declines were similar across gamekeeping activity levels. Wider surveys in 2006-12 found acid and rough grassland, and dwarf shrub heath and bog to be the two preferred habitats within lek ranges. Leks were attended by twice as many males where driven Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica shooting was practised. Occupied moorland habitat patches were 26 times larger than unoccupied patches. Conclusion: Black Grouse in southern Scotland are declining across all habitats. Moorland provides important habitat for remaining birds. With government targets to plant more woodland, remaining moorland habitat patches are likely to become more fragmented making them less able to support sustainable connected populations, which may exacerbate declines and enhance risk of regional extinction.	66	4	494-502	Yes	Likely Managed	Landscape	1	1989	276	Scotland		NA		To inform Black Grouse conservation programmes in southern Scotland we quantified recent trends in numbers, assessed habitat composition within lek ranges and evaluated the size of suitable habitat patches.

Botanical Journal of Scotland, 49(1), pp.27-37.	1997	Welch, D., Scott, D.	Decline of moorland plants following the establishment of a Scots pine plantation.	Botanical Journal of Scotland			A tract of heather (Calluna vulgaris) moorland on a brown-earth soil in north-east Scotland was planted with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in 1974, and the subsequent changes in heather and botanical composition were monitored. The pines established well and attained a mean girth of 37 cm by 1995. Before planting the moorland was heavily grazed by sheep which kept the heather short (mean height 7 cm) but with high cover (71%). After planting there have been three phases in the development of the ground vegetation. In the first eight years the heather benefited from the cessation of grazing, reaching 17 cm height and 89% cover in 1982. The cover of pine remained less than 5%, but grasses declined significantly in cover and some forbs became extinct e.g. Lotus corniculatus. In the second 8-yr phase the pine canopy closed but heather retained its dominance still having 89% cover in 1990 and a mean height of 20 cm. The main change in composition was a decline in the subsidiary dwarf shrubs (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Erica cinerea and Genista anglica), but grass cover was further reduced and more angiosperms became extinct. After 1990 there was rapid death of heather and a reduction in bryophyte cover, causing the extent of bare ground to increase. By 1995 the combined cover of all Vascular plants had fallen to 17%, and only Deschampsia flexuosa, Festuca ovina, Trientalis europaea and Vaccinium vitis-idaea seem likely to survive the intense shade of the thicket stage. Differences between the present flora and that of second-rotation and native pinewoods are discussed.	49	1	27-37	No	Not applicable 	Stand	1	1974	264	Scotland	Crathie	57.04290134	-3.220866773	To understand the observed plant distributions and to promote the conser- vation of an attractive habitat, extended monitoring over full rotations is required in the planted pinewoods, together with assessments on the relative contribution of the seed bank and immigrant propagules to colonization.

Aims To study Black Grouse habitat use within a moorland-forest mosaic and make recommendations for their conservation in more heavily forested future landscapes. Methods We carried out radio-telemetry on Black Grouse over three years to investigate individual habitat use. We used compositional analyses to investigate habitat selection in different seasons. We examined whether this matched previous population-level patterns and whether it differed between males and females. We used logistic regression to examine whether movements into large-scale commercial forests were restricted to the periphery relative to random locations. Results Males used seasonal ranges of >200 ha and females >70 ha. Birds selected strongly for moorland throughout the year, matching other population-level studies. Underlying this, however, males and females differed in their use of forests, with males associated with Broadleaf woodland, while females preferred new native pinewoods in spring-summer or commercial conifer forests in autumn-winter. Use of commercial plantation forests was generally limited to their periphery, particularly to within <300 m of the forest edge. Conclusion When planning afforestation, moorland patches of at least 200 ha must be retained and their fragmentation should be minimized, particularly as young forests may provide breeding habitat over a limited duration. However, mature forests also form an important habitat component and, at a local scale, both coniferous and broadleaf forests should be made available to provide resources for both sexes. Some management decisions will therefore need to be made at the landscape-scale to balance broad national targets of afforestation with individual landowner/contractor decisions.

The influence of forest management systems on the abundance and diversity of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) in commercial plantations of Sitka spruce	Forest Ecology and Management	10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.014		Sitka spruce is the most widely planted conifer tree species in the UK, and is generally grown in dense monocultures managed using the clear-cut system. This study investigates the influence of alternative management systems (shelterwood and selection systems) on captures of bark beetles and associated predators. Bark beetle abundance was significantly lower in stands managed by shelterwood and selection systems when compared to mid (21â€“40Â years old) and mature (â‰¥41Â years old) stands managed by the clear-cutting method. The abundance of bark beetles, including individual species, within plots could not be fully explained however, using linear mixed model analysis that not only included the various site characteristics assessed within each plot (numbers of live and dead trees), but also the numbers of predatory beetles (Rhizophagidae and Salpingidae). This suggested that the influence of management type on bark beetle abundance was not entirely due to the bottom-up or top-down forces that were assessed in the study, and that other abiotic and/or biotic factors were likely to be influential. Bark beetle diversity was also influenced by the management system, however higher diversity values within some group selection managed plots were only apparent in circumstances when stands of Sitka spruce had been managed using this system for a considerable period of time, and the habitat had remained undisturbed for a relatively long period of time (i.e. no harvesting interventions). Significantly higher numbers of predatory beetles were captured within the mid and mature clear-cut managed stands. The results from the study indicate that adopting alternative management systems to manage Sitka spruce in the UK could be a potential strategy to mitigate likely increases in bark beetle populations associated with climate change.

We measure forestry edge effects on open-ground breeding birds, following one of Europe's biggest and most controversial land-use transformations. The 'Flow Country' of northern Scotland is one of the world's greatest expanses of blanket bog. It became fragmented by conifer forests planted in the late 20th century, and these now adjoin open peatlands protected under European conservation legislation. Detrimental edge effects on breeding birds were anticipated, but not apparent shortly after planting. Using survey data collected in 2003-2006, and logistic regression modelling, we tested whether breeding distributions of three wader species of international conservation concern, dunlin, European golden plover and common greenshank, were influenced by distance to forest edge, controlling for habitat and topography. All three species were more likely to occupy flatter, more exposed ground close to bog pools and were influenced by peatland vegetation structure. There was an additive and adverse effect of proximity to forest edge for dunlin and European golden plover, but not common greenshank. This effect was strongest within 700 m of forest edges. We used these results to predict which areas should benefit most from removal of adjacent forestry and so guide maintenance and restoration of the bird interests of the protected areas. Synthesis and applications. Edge effects of mature forestry on dunlin and golden plover are apparent over several hundred metres and are now being used to guide forest planning in northern Scotland. The scale of edge effect is broadly consistent with other avian studies in open-ground habitats across Eurasia and North America, so buffer zones of this order are consistent with possible impacts of plantation forestry on open-ground habitats of bird conservation interest. Given renewed interest in conifer afforestation as a climate change mitigation measure, an improved understanding of edge effects and the mechanisms through which they operate is vital to managing plantation forestry in ways that maintain open-ground landscapes of high conservation value.

Quantitative data on lichen communities on saxicolous, epiphytic and terricolous substrata were collected from 16 hectares in one km2 in each landuse type. Multivariate analyses, NMDS and Cluster analysis were used to identify lichen communities associated with environmental factors including landuse, substratum type and age. The epiphytic community of native pinewoods was distinguished from all others by the highest species richness, the presence of indicators of ecological continuity and the absence of nitrophytes, while the epiphytic communities of farmland were distinguished by absence of acidophytes and a high contribution of nitrophytes. Plantations of conifers were distinguished by low species richness and an increase in tolerant species. Saxicolous communities were frequent on walls in all sites except native pinewood, where saxicolous substrata were rare. Intensively farmed sites were distinguished by an increase in percentage contribution of nitrophytes. The high acidophyte contribution in all sites suggests that crustose species of acid rocks may not respond rapidly to an increase in applied nitrogen. In landscapes where tree cover is sparse or non-existent combined assessment of habitat diversity and nitrophyte indicator species can be used to assess changes associated with agricultural intensification.

Quantitative data on lichen communities on saxicolous, epiphytic and terricolous substrata were collected from 16 hectares in one km2 in each landuse type. Multivariate analyses, NMDS and Cluster analysis were used to identify lichen communities associated with environmental factors including landuse, substratum type and age. The epiphytic community of native pinewoods was distinguished from all others by the highest species richness, the presence of indicators of ecological continuity and the absence of nitrophytes, while the epiphytic communities of farmland were distinguished by absence of acidophytes and a high contribution of nitrophytes. Plantations of conifers were distinguished by low species richness and an increase in tolerant species. Saxicolous communities were frequent on walls in all sites except native pinewood, where saxicolous substrata were rare. Intensively farmed sites were distinguished by an increase in percentage contribution of nitrophytes. The high acidophyte contribution in all sites suggests that crustose species of acid rocks may not respond rapidly to an increase in applied nitrogen. In landscapes where tree cover is sparse or non-existent combined assessment of habitat diversity and nitrophyte indicator species can be used to assess changes associated with agricultural intensification.

This provided the basis for an investigation of factors affecting the species density and composition of epiphytic lichen communities. Fifteen 1Â hectare plots were established in the same sites as a parallel invertebrate survey, of which nine were in old growth forest and six in oak plantations of between c. 150 and 300Â years old. In each plot 12 trees were identified for sampling and lichens were sampled on four aspects of each trunk. Results at the plot level showed that species density was significantly higher in the old growth woodland plots from those in plantations. Plot age had a significant effect on species on oak but this was not significant for lichen communities on beech. The species density of lichens associated with Trentepohliaceae photobionts on oaks showed a linear positive relationship with increasing plot age while the species density of species with other coccal green Chlorophyta decreased with age of the plot. A major part of the lichenised fungi with Trentepohliaceae photobionts includes indicator and notable species used in conservation evaluation and this component is most affected by fragmentation and isolation of forest sites. The results emphasise the importance of long term connectivity and ecological continuity in this extensive mosaic of lowland deciduous forest.

Considerable variation in the type and intensity of management within these four woodland types existed. Adult Diptera from 21 families, representing diverse trophic and ecological guilds, were sampled from 31 woodlands in the Aberdeenshire region of northeast Scotland, between June and August 2001. Environmental differences between woodlands were recorded at each site using environmental parameters such as pH and organic matter content, vegetation characteristics, including percentage canopy cover and dominant field layer plant species. Multivariate ordination techniques detected significant responses in the Dipteran communities to soil type, organic matter content, soil pH, field layer plant species richness, dominant field layer plant species and percentage cover of Pteridium aquilinum. Responses in terms of Dipteran abundance, species richness, diversity and evenness were observed to soil type and dominant species of the field layer vegetation. The role of woodland type and management in diversifying Diptera communities is discussed with a view to maintain and possibly enhance Dipteran and other invertebrate communities in Scottish secondary woodlands.

Changing management in Scottish birch woodlands: A potential threat to local invertebrate biodiversity	Bulletin of Entomological Research	10.1079/BER2003227	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037386316&doi=10.1079%2fBER2003227&partnerID=40&md5=f4663b5223263945590353c5d525fcfc	The silvicultural management of Scottish birch woodlands for timber production is replacing traditional low intensity management practices, such as domesticated livestock grazing. These new management practices involve thinning of existing woodlands to prescribed densities to maximize biomass and timber quality. Although presently infrequent, the wide scale adoption of this practice could affect invertebrate community diversity. The impact of these changes in management on Staphylinidae and Carabidae (Coleoptera) in 19 woodlands in Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland was investigated. Grazing and logging practices were important determinants of beetle community structure. Woodland area had no effect on any measure of beetle community structure, although isolation did influence the abundance of one carabid species. Changes towards timber production forestry will influence the structure of invertebrate communities, although the scale at which this occurs will determine its effect.	93	2	159-167	Yes	Managed	Stand	1	2000	4	Scotland	Dee	57.08243463	-2.892754704	This study hypothesizes that the current diversity in management practices associated with birch woodlands helps to maintain between site heterogeneity in environmental conditions.

Effects of land-use and agricultural management on birds of marginal farmland: a case study in the Llŷn peninsula, Wales. 	Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment			Extensive pastoral farming and marginal land are important for many bird species of conservation concern. This study identified the bird species associated with a range of marginal upland habitats in the Llŷn peninsula in Wales and discusses the impact on these species of further land-use change. Bird and habitat surveys of 45 sites were conducted between May and July 2000. The bird species observed at each site were recorded along with the densities of eight species characteristic of marginal farmland. Sites were assigned to land management categories representing different management intensity and land-use options. A binary similarity index was used to quantify species associations with each of these categories and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to identify associations with individual habitat characteristics. Habitat differences were largely attributable to differences in management. Very few species were recorded on intensively managed sites, although house martin Delichon urbica and swallow Hirundo rustica were significantly associated with improved grassland with scrub or bracken. Sites that were abandoned or under-managed had a high tree density, high cover of bracken Pteridium aquilinium and supported many common scrub or woodland species. Extensively managed sites with unimproved grassland, shrub heath, bracken and scrub (ffridd) were found to be important for several species, including chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax, wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe, mistle thrush Turdus viscivorus, stonechat Saxicola toquata and meadow pipit Anthus pratensis. High densities of yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and linnet Carduelis cannabina occurred on sites with improved grassland and gorse Ulex europaeus. This study highlights the need for a diversity of habitats on marginal farmland, which is most likely to be achieved through the distribution of funds to marginal areas through agri-environment and rural development measures.	107	4	331-340	Yes	Managed	Stand	5	2000	3	Wales	Llŷn Peninsula	52.916007	-4.504722042	This paperconsiders the effects of land-use and management on the bird species associated with marginal farmland using the Llyˆn peninsula in north Wales as a case study.

In 1997, between 1426 and 1552 Woodlark territories were located in Britain. There has been a considerable increase in the population since the only previous national survey, in 1986, when approximately 250 territories were found. The five regions of population that were apparent in 1986 all showed major increases, in particular in Breckland and the Suffolk Sandlings. Over 85% of territories occurred on heathland or within forest plantations. The ratio varied between regions: plantations were more commonly used in the north and east whereas more Woodlarks utilized heathland in the south. Woodlarks in Devon bred almost exclusively on farmland. More than three-quarters of the forest population was found in young plantations, particularly in stands of two and three year old trees. Most Woodlark territories were located on sandy soils, with nearly 70% specifically on acid sandy soils. Reasons for the observed increase and range expansion are discussed, as are the implications of habitat management practices.

In Scotland, self-selected 10-km squares were surveyed by volunteers and a stratified random selection of the remaining 10-km squares within the known breeding range was surveyed.Results: The UK and Isle of Man Hen Harrier population was estimated at 575 territorial pairs (95% confidence limits, 477-694), a non-significant decline of 13% since 2010 but a significant decline of 24% since 2004. Scotland held the majority (80%) of the population with 460 (359-573) territorial pairs. Elsewhere, 46 territorial pairs were recorded in Northern Ireland, 35 in Wales, 30 in the Isle of Man and four in England. Significant decreases were recorded in the number of pairs in Scotland using grouse moor (-57%) and young forest (-54%).Conclusion: The combined breeding population of Hen Harriers in the UK and Isle of Man has shown a non-significant decline between 2010 and 2016. There were notable decreases in England, Northern Ireland and Wales since 2010.	65	2	145-160	Yes	Likely Managed	Landscape	1	2016	Not reported	England;Northern Ireland;Scotland;Wales		NA		The aims of the survey were to: provide updated estimates of population size by country and region; identify trends since the last survey, nationally and regionally; and provide data for further analyses of drivers of change in breeding Hen Harrier populations in the UK and Isle of Man.
