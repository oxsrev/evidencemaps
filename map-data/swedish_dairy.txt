Comparing welfare indicators in dairy cattle under different loose housing systems (deep litter vs cubicle barns) using recycled manure solids for bedding	Spanish Journal of Agricultural Research	http://dx.doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2020181-15287		https://revistas.inia.es/index.php/sjar/article/view/15287	Aim of study: Dairy farmers in Southern Spain are continuously investing in the modernization of their facilities and frequently ask technicians about the type of housing they should choose for their farms. Although some studies have analysed the economic impact of different housing systems, there are no reports evaluating the impact of these systems on animal wellbeing. To remedy this deficit, a study was carried out to analyse animal welfare status in two types of loose housing conditions: deep litter (DL) and cubicle (CU) barns. Area of study: This study was conducted in Cordoba (Spain). Material and methods: A total of 1,597 cows from nineteen commercial dairy farms were involved in this study, of which twelve had CU barns and seven had DL barns. Welfare Quality assessment was used to evaluate animal wellbeing, inn order to compare both housing systems. Main results: The study found some weaknesses for feeding and health indicators of animal welfare in both types of housing systems. The overall welfare assessment based on feeding, housing and health indicators showed no differences between farms with DL or CU barns. Research highlights: A good welfare status could be reached under any type of housing system.	18	1		English	Sub National	19		Spain	Europe	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The present study was conducted to compare welfare assessment based on feeding, housing and health principles in dairy cows reared under two different loose-housing systems: deep litter barns and cubicle barns.	0.08333333333	Oct 2015-Nov 2015	19	19	1597	NR	N	SCC/SCS;Clinical lameness;Dirty legs;Dirty udders;Very lean cows;Vaginal discharge;Coughs;Nasal discharge;severe integument alteration;Mild integument alteration;Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD);Ocular discharge	%;SCC	8

The experimental materials comprised Polish Holstein-Friesian cattle raised in 2006-2009. The objective of this study was to compare SCC, the yield and composition of milk from Holstein-Friesian Black-and-White cows kept in the tie-stall and free-stall system for four years. The analysis indicates that cows housed in a tie-stall barn (herd A) were characterized by higher milk performance than cows kept in a freestall barn (herd B). Milk yield was correlated with SCC in milk in both herds. Yield increase in the A herd was connected with the SCC decrease. Such dependence has not been found in the herd B.	10	3	55-64	English	Site Specific	2		Poland		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The objective of this study was to compare SCC, the yield and composition of milk from Holstein-Friesian Black-and-White cows kept in the tie-stall and free-stall system for four years.	4	2006-2009	2	2	125	Holstein cross	N	SCC/SCS	kg;ml;SCC	8

The negative impact of heat stress on health and productivity of dairy cows is well known. Heat stress can be quantified with the temperature-humidity index (THI) and is defined as a THI ≥ 72. Additionally, animal welfare is affected in cows living under heat stress conditions. Finding a way to quantify heat stress in dairy cows has been of increasing interest over the past decades. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate concentrations of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites [i.e. 11,17-dioxoandrostanes (11,17-DOA)] as an indirect stress parameter in dairy cows without heat stress (DOA 0), with heat stress on a single day (acute heat stress, DOA 1) or with more than a single day of heat stress (chronic heat stress, DOA 2). Cows were housed in five farms under moderate European climates. Two statistical approaches (approach 1 and approach 2) were assessed. Using approach 1, concentrations of faecal 11,17-DOA were compared among DOA 0, DOA 1 and DOA 2 samples regardless of their origin (i.e. cow, unpaired comparison with a one-way anova). Using approach 2, a cow was considered as its own control; that is 11,17-DOA was treated as a cow-specific factor and only paired samples were included in the analysis for this approach (paired comparison with t-tests). In approach 1 (p = 0.006) and approach 2 (p = 0.038), 11,17-DOA values of cows under acute heat stress were higher compared to those of cows without heat stress. Our results also indicate that acute heat stress has to be considered as a confounder in studies measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in cows to evaluate other stressful situations.	51	3	392-399	English	Site Specific	5		Germany;Hungary;France		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The overall objective of this study was to evaluate if acute and chronic heat stress in individual dairy cows is associated with concentrations of faecal 11,17-DOA.

The negative impact of heat stress on health and productivity of dairy cows is well known. Heat stress can be quantified with the temperature-humidity index (THI) and is defined as a THI ≥ 72. Additionally, animal welfare is affected in cows living under heat stress conditions. Finding a way to quantify heat stress in dairy cows has been of increasing interest over the past decades. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate concentrations of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites [i.e. 11,17-dioxoandrostanes (11,17-DOA)] as an indirect stress parameter in dairy cows without heat stress (DOA 0), with heat stress on a single day (acute heat stress, DOA 1) or with more than a single day of heat stress (chronic heat stress, DOA 2). Cows were housed in five farms under moderate European climates. Two statistical approaches (approach 1 and approach 2) were assessed. Using approach 1, concentrations of faecal 11,17-DOA were compared among DOA 0, DOA 1 and DOA 2 samples regardless of their origin (i.e. cow, unpaired comparison with a one-way anova).

The mastitis incidence during the lactation periods increased gradually from calving to the 120th \lactation day. For the first 120 days of lactation, the mastitis incidence attained 26%. The reduction in milk yields after the lactation peak was associated with \gradual decline in cows affected by mastitis to 1.7% during the last month of lactation. With increasing the number of lactations, mastitis incidence also \increased: 23.3% in 1st lactation cows, 26.7% in 2nd lactation cows, 48.9% in 3rd lactation cows and 43.3% in cows in fourth or subsequent lactation. The \highest daily milk yield at the peak of lactation (34.05 kg) was established in cows affected by mastitis after the 180th lactation day, followed by cows with \mastitis between the 60th and 180th lactation days (32.54 kg), and third came healthy cows (31.98 kg). The lowest daily milk yield at the peak of lactation was \demonstrated in cows affected by mastitis in the first 60 days of the lactation (29.39 kg). It was proved that cows with exceptionally high milk yields in the \beginning of lactation were more prone to mastitis at a later stage due to weakened systemic resistance and consequent disease. Cows with relatively lower \milk yield during the lactation period (7580.3 kg) were more resistant to environmental factors, therefore were not affected by mastitis and produced high-\quality milk with lower costs vs those with highest milk yields affected by mastitis after the 180th day. These cows produced more milk (7607.9 kg) within a 305-\day lactation, but the treatment costs could be hardly compensated. Cows in which mastitis occurred until the 60th and between the 60th and 180th lactation \nday, produced 7215.5 and 7484.1 kg milk, respectively. The average milk yield per lactation of healthy cows was by 137.83 kg higher than that of cows with \mastitis.

Effect of season, lactation period and number of lactation on mastitis incidence and milk yields in dairy cows	Agricultural Science and Technology			http://agriscitech.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/026.pdf	The aim of the present study was to study the effect of the season, period and number of lactation on mastitis incidence and milk yields in dairy cows. \The climate in Bulgaria implies the presence of seasonal variations in mastitis prevalence in dairy cows, reared in free-stall barns all the year round: spring – \n5.33%, summer – 4.9%, autumn – 4.2% and winter – 4.5%. The mastitis incidence during the lactation periods increased gradually from calving to the 120th \lactation day. For the first 120 days of lactation, the mastitis incidence attained 26%. The reduction in milk yields after the lactation peak was associated with \gradual decline in cows affected by mastitis to 1.7% during the last month of lactation. With increasing the number of lactations, mastitis incidence also \increased: 23.3% in 1st lactation cows, 26.7% in 2nd lactation cows, 48.9% in 3rd lactation cows and 43.3% in cows in fourth or subsequent lactation. The \highest daily milk yield at the peak of lactation (34.05 kg) was established in cows affected by mastitis after the 180th lactation day, followed by cows with \mastitis between the 60th and 180th lactation days (32.54 kg), and third came healthy cows (31.98 kg). The lowest daily milk yield at the peak of lactation was \demonstrated in cows affected by mastitis in the first 60 days of the lactation (29.39 kg). It was proved that cows with exceptionally high milk yields in the \beginning of lactation were more prone to mastitis at a later stage due to weakened systemic resistance and consequent disease. Cows with relatively lower \milk yield during the lactation period (7580.3 kg) were more resistant to environmental factors, therefore were not affected by mastitis and produced high-\quality milk with lower costs vs those with highest milk yields affected by mastitis after the 180th day. These cows produced more milk (7607.9 kg) within a 305-\day lactation, but the treatment costs could be hardly compensated. Cows in which mastitis occurred until the 60th and between the 60th and 180th lactation \nday, produced 7215.5 and 7484.1 kg milk, respectively. The average milk yield per lactation of healthy cows was by 137.83 kg higher than that of cows with \mastitis. A statistically significant reduction in milk fat (Р < 0.05) and milk protein (Р < 0.001) between healthy and diseased cows was observed.	6	2	231-238	English	National	3		Bulgaria		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SEASON LACTATION PERIOD AND LACTATION NUMBER ON MASTITIS PREVALENCE AND RELATIONSHIPS TO PRODUCTION TRAITS IN DAIRY COWS	2	2010-2012	3	3	300	Holstein cross	N	Mastitis	%	7

Linear type traits for feet and legs, their relation to health traits connected with them, and with productive and reproductive traits in dairy cows	Bulgarian Journal of Agricultural Science			http://www.agrojournal.org/	The objective of the study was to estimate the correlations between linear type traits for feet and legs, and their relation with locomotion disorders and productive and reproductive traits in Holstein cows reared in Bulgaria. The study included 136 cows from four dairy farms of different regions of Bulgaria. In all farms, cows were year-round reared group in free stalls with individual boxes for rest. In the study 7 linear type traits for feet and legs and the trait heel depth were included. On cows also a lameness scoring on a scale of 1 to 4 was carried out. Phenotypic correlations between linear traits were low. In cows with wider and parallel placed rear legs a tendency to straighter hock (-0.20) was reported, which was associated with a steeper foot (-0.16) and flatter hocks (-0.18). Cows with thicker bones and steeper foot (0.24) had and deeper heel (-0.24). When selection for thinner bones and optimal foot angle is conducted, it would be likely the heel depth to decline. Cows with straighter hock (-0.16), lower foot angle (0.18), shallower heel (-0.25) and better locomotion (0.25) had higher milk yield for 305 days. The selection for higher milk yield will be associated with a tendency for unfavorable phenotypic deviations in the various linear traits for feet and legs, with the exception of bone structure and locomotion. Cows with more pronounced X-shaped rear legsrear view (-0.18), with flatter and dry hocks (0.16) and with thicker bones (-0.25) had longer interval from calving to first insemination. Cows with thicker bones had smaller number of inseminations for conception (0.20). The phenotypic correlations between clinical problems with feet and legs and linear traits were with low values (from -0.01 to 0.10). With the highest and negative value was the phenotypic correlation between linear trait locomotion and clinical problems with legs and feet (-0.37). Using only the linear traits for feet and legs to reduce the locomotive problems, without additional information about the various clinical problems with legs and feet will not have a considerable effect.	23	3	467-475	English	National	4		Bulgaria	Gabrovo|Plovdiv|Stara Zagora|Sliven	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	To estimate the correlations between linear type traits for feet and legs and their relation with locomotion disorders, and on productive and reproductive traits in Holstein cows reared in Bulgaria.	0.5	NR	4	4	136	Holstein	N	Leg Diseases;Lameness (Unspecified);Locomotion Difficulties	%	8

Following calving, HF (n = 39) and N (n = 45) heifers were allocated to 1 of 3 systems of production (high level of concentrate, low level of concentrate, and grass-based). High- and low-concentrate animals were continuously housed indoors on a rotational system so that they spent similar amounts of time on slatted and solid concrete floors. Animals on the grass treatment grazed from spring to autumn in both years of the study, so that most animals on this treatment grazed from around peak to late lactation. Claw health was recorded in both hind claws of each animal at 4 observation periods during each lactation as follows: 1) -8 to 70 d postcalving, 2) 71 to 150 d postcalving, 3) 151 to 225 d postcalving, and 4) 226 to 364 d postcalving. Sole lesions, heel erosion, axial wall deviation, sole length of the right lateral hind claw (claw length), right heel width, and right lateral hind heel height were recorded as well as the presence of digital dermatitis. The N cows had lower (better) white line and total lesion scores than HF cows. Cows on the high- and low-concentrate treatments had better sole and total lesion scores than cows on the grass treatment. The HF cows had better locomotion scores than N cows. Breed and production system differences were observed with respect to claw conformation, including claw length, heel width, and heel height.

Effects of breed and production system on lameness parameters in dairy cattle	Journal of Dairy Science	https://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-1333		http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med7&NEWS=N&AN=19389976	The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of Holstein-Friesian (HF) and Norwegian (N) dairy cattle genotypes on lameness parameters in dairy cattle within different production systems over the first 2 lactations. Following calving, HF (n = 39) and N (n = 45) heifers were allocated to 1 of 3 systems of production (high level of concentrate, low level of concentrate, and grass-based). High- and low-concentrate animals were continuously housed indoors on a rotational system so that they spent similar amounts of time on slatted and solid concrete floors. Animals on the grass treatment grazed from spring to autumn in both years of the study, so that most animals on this treatment grazed from around peak to late lactation. Claw health was recorded in both hind claws of each animal at 4 observation periods during each lactation as follows: 1) -8 to 70 d postcalving, 2) 71 to 150 d postcalving, 3) 151 to 225 d postcalving, and 4) 226 to 364 d postcalving. Sole lesions, heel erosion, axial wall deviation, sole length of the right lateral hind claw (claw length), right heel width, and right lateral hind heel height were recorded as well as the presence of digital dermatitis. The N cows had lower (better) white line and total lesion scores than HF cows. Cows on the high- and low-concentrate treatments had better sole and total lesion scores than cows on the grass treatment. The HF cows had better locomotion scores than N cows. Breed and production system differences were observed with respect to claw conformation, including claw length, heel width, and heel height. Digital dermatitis was associated with worse sole lesion scores and interacted with production system to influence white line lesion scores and maximum heel erosion scores. This study shows that genetic, environmental, and infectious factors are associated with hoof pathologies in dairy cows.	92	5	2174-2182	English	Site Specific	1		United Kingdom		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of these breeds on lameness by comparing the claw pathologies and locomotion scores in HF and N breeds managed on 3 different production systems.	2	2000-2001	1	3	84	Holstein cross;Norwegian Red	N	Heel Horn erosion;Sole Lesion;White line lesion;Maximum axial wall deviation;Locomotion Difficulties	Means	6

However, there is currently limited knowledge available on the endocrine and biochemical changes in animals housed in such alternative systems. Therefore, this study aimed to measure blood cortisol (COR) and beta-endorphins (BE) in 22 two-year-old primiparae Fleckvieh cows, who were randomly allotted to the following two different housing systems: CB (n = 11) and FB (n = 11). Blood samples were collected at the beginning of the experiment (T0) and every two months thereafter (T1, T2, and T3). The COR and BE were measured through an immunoenzymatic kit. With the only exception being T0, no differences were observed over time between the two groups, neither for COR nor for BE. However, the blood cortisol levels of the CB cows decreased over time, while a T1 peak was identified in the FB group. On the contrary, both the housing systems displayed numerically higher BE at T3 than at the other experimental times. Therefore, the overall data suggest that the compost-bedded pack barn did not significantly affect the studied parameters. Accordingly, cow welfare should be assessed using a wider panel of animal-based indicators. © 2021 by the authors.

Heritabilities for claw disorders are low, yet claw health can substantially be improved by optimizing the housing and management of dairy herds. Dairy farms in Finland are different from those in many other countries; the main breed is Ayrshire, the average herd size is small, the frequency of infectious claw disorders is low and cows are usually kept indoors for long winter periods. Previous studies have focused mainly on loose-housed (L) herds and Holstein cows. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cow-level and herd-level factors on infectious and non-infectious claw disorders in tied (T) and L herds. Another aim was to quantify the total variance of claw disorders explained by the effect of claw trimmers. The claw health data were collected by professional claw trimmers between 2003 and 2010 from 28,645 cows in 949 T herds and 10,495 cows in 262 L herds in Finland. The effects of cow-level and herd-level factors on claw health of individual cows during routine trimmings were analysed using generalised linear mixed models. The prevalence of claw disorders increased together with parity (p0.001) and cows in early and mid-lactation had the highest odds of developing claw disorders (p0.05). Cows always kept indoors in T herds had higher odds of non-infectious claw disorders (OR=1.45, p0.001) than cows with access to outdoors during summer, whereas cows with access to summer pasture and winter exercise yard were the most likely to have infectious claw disorders. In T herds, use of rubber mats in stalls (OR=0.60, p0.001) significantly reduced the odds of infectious claw disorders. Cows fed total mixed ration (OR=0.46 for infectious, OR=0.63 for non-infectious, p0.001) and kept on solid floor (OR=0.52 for infectious, OR=0.72 for non-infectious, p0.001) had the lowest odds of claw disorders in L herds. Cows trimmed once a year had less infectious claw disorders (T herds, OR=0.56, p0.001) and non-infectious claw disorders (L herds, OR=0.82, p0.05) than cows trimmed at least twice a year. Between-trimmer variances and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were high, ICCs being 8-9% in the non-infectious and 14-20% in the infectious disorder group. Because most herd-level factors were different between housing types and disorder groups housing and management recommendations should be tailored for individual herds depending on housing type and whether claw health problems are mostly infectious or non-infectious.

The objective of this study was to estimate effects of cubicle characteristics on animal welfare indicators in dairy cattle. A total of 64 loose housing farms in Germany were assessed once during the winter housing period by one experienced assessor. Nearly 15% of the dairy cows had access to pasture during summer months for <6 h/day, whereas 85% were zero-grazing farms. Selected animal welfare indicators (duration of the lying down process, collisions of cows with cubicles, cows lying outside cubicles, cow cleanliness, integument alterations, lameness and subclinical mastitis incidence) of the Welfare QualityR protocol and cubicle characteristics such as cow-to-cubicle ratio and cubicle dimensions were recorded. Data were statistically analysed using a multiple linear regression approach. Pasture access and cubicle type were considered as potential influencing factors. Wider cubicles positively affected the proportion of dairy cows with dirty flanks (-18.5% per 10 cm increase) but increased the number of cows with severe integument alterations (+8.9% per 10 cm increase). Larger lying areas reduced the percentage of cows with dirty udders (-2.9% per 10 cm2 increase). Longer distances from neck rail to curb were associated with higher prevalence of cows with dirty flanks (+3.1% per 10 cm increase) and subclinical mastitis incidence (+1.2% per 10 cm increase). With increasing neck rail height, the duration of the lying down process (-0.1 s per 10% increase), the percentages of cows with dirty legs (-8.4% per 10 cm increase), dirty udders (-7.0% per 10 cm increase) and severe lameness (-3.0% per 10 cm increase) decreased. Compared with rubber mat-equipped cubicles, deep-bedded cubicles showed a reduction in the lying down duration (-0.8 s), percentages of cows with dirty legs (-34.2%), dirty udders (-30.5%) and lesions and swellings (-13.1%). Compared with farms that did not provide any summer grazing, pasture access was associated with an increase of cows with severe lameness (+5.6%). Contrastingly, the number of cows with subclinical mastitis incidence was lower when cows had access to pasture in summer (-5.4%). Findings of the present study indicate several associations between cubicle characteristics and animal welfare in dairy cattle. Bedding type was found as the most influencing factor in terms of health and behaviour. Results of this study are valuable for farmers to identify the optimal cubicle design and improve the animal welfare level.	14	9	1934-1942	English	Sub National	64		Germany	Northern Germany	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The objective of this study was to examine the various relationships between cubicle characteristics and related animal welfare indicators.	2	Winter 2014-Winter 2016	64	64	23968	Holstein cross	N	Mastitis;Severe Lameness;Dirty legs;Dirty udders;Dirty Legs/Flanks/Udders;Collisions with cubicles;Cows lying outside cubicles;Lesions and swellings	Welfare Quality® protocol	8

Our objective was to compare the composition of bedding materials and manure, cow welfare and hygiene assessments, measures of milk production and quality, and incidence of mastitis during a 3-yr trial with lactating Holstein cows housed in a freestall barn containing 4 identical pens with 32 freestalls/pen. Bedding systems evaluated included deep-bedded organic manure solids (DBOS), shallow-bedded manure solids spread over mattresses (MAT), deep-bedded recycled sand (RSA), and deep-bedded new sand (NSA). The experiment was designed as a 4 × 4 Latin square with 4 bedding systems and 4 experimental periods, but was terminated after 3 yr following discussions with the consulting statistician; therefore, data were analyzed as an incomplete Latin square. A total of n = 734 mostly primiparous cows (n = 725 primiparous, n = 9 multiparous; 224 to 267 cows/yr) were enrolled in the trial. Before placement in freestalls, organic solids (OS) exhibited lower concentrations of dry matter (36.5 vs. 94.3%), and greater concentrations of volatile solids, C, N, NH(4)-N, P, water-extractable P, K, and S compared with RSA or NSA. Cow comfort index was greater for sand-bedded systems compared with those using OS (88.4 vs. 82.8%). Cows bedded in systems using OS (DBOS and MAT) exhibited greater mean hock scores (1 = no swelling, no hair loss; 2 = no swelling, bald area on hock) than those bedded in sand (1.25 vs. 1.04), but this effect was entirely associated with use of mattresses (MAT), which differed sharply from DBOS (1.42 vs. 1.07). Generally, hygiene scores for legs, flanks, and udders were numerically similar for DBOS, NSA, and RSA bedding systems, and differences between bedding systems were associated entirely with MAT, yielding detectable contrasts between MAT and DBOS for legs (2.94 vs. 2.20), flanks (2.34 vs. 1.68), and udders (1.83 vs. 1.38). No significant contrast comparing bedding systems was detected for measures of milk production or quality. Documented cases of clinical mastitis requiring treatment ranged from a low rate of 7.4 cases/yr for RSA to a high of 23.1 cases/yr for DBOS, based on a mean enrollment of 60.7 to 63.0 cows/treatment per yr. Cows bedded with OS exhibited a greater incidence of mastitis than those bedded with sand (19.0 vs. 8.4 cases/yr), but no differences were observed for comparisons within individual bedding-material types. Collectively, these results generally favored use of sand-bedding materials over systems using OS.	102	7	6682-6698	English	Site Specific	1		United States of America	Wisconsin	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	Our objectives for this 3-yr study were to evaluate the composition of bedding materials and manure, as well as the production, health, hygiene, and milk quality of primarily primiparous cows housed in a common freestall barn bedded with deep-bedded OS (DBOS), shallow-bedded OS spread over mattresses (MAT), recycled sand (RSA), or new sand (NSA), where the OS and RSA were reclaimed as by-products of the manure separation system.	3	Jan2014-Dec 2016	1	4	743	Holstein	N	Mastitis;Heel Horn erosion;Interdigital hyperplasia;Sole haemorrhages;Sole ulcer;Under-Run sole;White Line abscess;White Line fissures;Interdigital Phlegmon;Corkscrew;Lameness (Unspecified);Locomotion Difficulties;Dermatitis;Locomotion;Dirty flanks;Dirty legs;Dirty udders;Body condition	#;%;Cow Comfort Index;Hock Score;Locomotion Score	8

Generally, hygiene scores for legs, flanks, and udders were numerically similar for DBOS, NSA, and RSA bedding systems, and differences between bedding systems were associated entirely with MAT, yielding detectable contrasts between MAT and DBOS for legs (2.94 vs. 2.20), flanks (2.34 vs. 1.68), and udders (1.83 vs. 1.38). No significant contrast comparing bedding systems was detected for measures of milk production or quality. Documented cases of clinical mastitis requiring treatment ranged from a low rate of 7.4 cases/yr for RSA to a high of 23.1 cases/yr for DBOS, based on a mean enrollment of 60.7 to 63.0 cows/treatment per yr. Cows bedded with OS exhibited a greater incidence of mastitis than those bedded with sand (19.0 vs. 8.4 cases/yr), but no differences were observed for comparisons within individual bedding-material types. Collectively, these results generally favored use of sand-bedding materials over systems using OS.	102	7	6682-6698	English	Site Specific	1		United States of America	Wisconsin	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	Our objectives for this 3-yr study were to evaluate the composition of bedding materials and manure, as well as the production, health, hygiene, and milk quality of primarily primiparous cows housed in a common freestall barn bedded with deep-bedded OS (DBOS), shallow-bedded OS spread over mattresses (MAT), recycled sand (RSA), or new sand (NSA), where the OS and RSA were reclaimed as by-products of the manure separation system.	3	Jan2014-Dec 2016	1	4	743	Holstein	N	Mastitis;Heel Horn erosion;Interdigital hyperplasia;Sole haemorrhages;Sole ulcer;Under-Run sole;White Line abscess;White Line fissures;Interdigital Phlegmon;Corkscrew;Lameness (Unspecified);Locomotion Difficulties;Dermatitis;Locomotion;Dirty flanks;Dirty legs;Dirty udders;Body condition	#;%;Cow Comfort Index;Hock Score;Locomotion Score	8

Efficacy of recycled sand or organic solids as bedding sources for lactating cows housed in freestalls	Journal of Dairy Science	10.3168/jds.2018-15851;10.3168/jds.2018-15851. Epub 2019 May 23.			Our objective was to compare the composition of bedding materials and manure, cow welfare and hygiene assessments, measures of milk production and quality, and incidence of mastitis during a 3-yr trial with lactating Holstein cows housed in a freestall barn containing 4 identical pens with 32 freestalls/pen. Bedding systems evaluated included deep-bedded organic manure solids (DBOS), shallow-bedded manure solids spread over mattresses (MAT), deep-bedded recycled sand (RSA), and deep-bedded new sand (NSA). The experiment was designed as a 4 × 4 Latin square with 4 bedding systems and 4 experimental periods, but was terminated after 3 yr following discussions with the consulting statistician; therefore, data were analyzed as an incomplete Latin square. A total of n = 734 mostly primiparous cows (n = 725 primiparous, n = 9 multiparous; 224 to 267 cows/yr) were enrolled in the trial. Before placement in freestalls, organic solids (OS) exhibited lower concentrations of dry matter (36.5 vs. 94.3%), and greater concentrations of volatile solids, C, N, NH(4)-N, P, water-extractable P, K, and S compared with RSA or NSA. Cow comfort index was greater for sand-bedded systems compared with those using OS (88.4 vs. 82.8%). Cows bedded in systems using OS (DBOS and MAT) exhibited greater mean hock scores (1 = no swelling, no hair loss; 2 = no swelling, bald area on hock) than those bedded in sand (1.25 vs. 1.04), but this effect was entirely associated with use of mattresses (MAT), which differed sharply from DBOS (1.42 vs. 1.07). Generally, hygiene scores for legs, flanks, and udders were numerically similar for DBOS, NSA, and RSA bedding systems, and differences between bedding systems were associated entirely with MAT, yielding detectable contrasts between MAT and DBOS for legs (2.94 vs. 2.20), flanks (2.34 vs. 1.68), and udders (1.83 vs. 1.38). No significant contrast comparing bedding systems was detected for measures of milk production or quality. Documented cases of clinical mastitis requiring treatment ranged from a low rate of 7.4 cases/yr for RSA to a high of 23.1 cases/yr for DBOS, based on a mean enrollment of 60.7 to 63.0 cows/treatment per yr.

Low profile cross-ventilated freestall (CV) and compost bedded pack barns (CB) are two newer housing options for dairy producers in the Upper Midwest. The CV barns are fully enclosed facilities that rely on mechanical ventilation and typically use evaporative cooling for heat abatement during the warmer months. The CB barns are a loose housing system that is generally bedded with dry wood sawdust and tilled twice daily. The objectives of this study were to describe the housing system and assess air quality (aerial ammonia and hydrogen sulfide), air velocity, light intensity, temperature, and relative humidity in CV, CB, and naturally ventilated freestall barns (NV). This cohort study was conducted on 18 commercial dairy farms, 6 of each housing type, in Minnesota and eastern South Dakota. Farms were visited four times, once each season between January and November 2008. Ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, light intensity, and air velocity measurements were taken twice each visit with 10 measurements per sampling time. Aerial ammonia concentrations were significantly higher in CV barns than CB and NV barns (5.2, 3.9, and 3.3 ppm, respectively). Hydrogen sulfide concentrations were 18, 33, and 19 ppb in CB, CV, and NV barns, respectively. There was a trend for higher hydrogen sulfide concentrations in CV barns. Light intensity was significantly lower in CV barns than CB and NV barns (111, 480, and 392 lux, respectively). There were no differences in air velocity among the housing systems. The mechanically ventilated CV barns were warmer in the fall and winter than the CB and NV barns. When outside temperature was above 27C, CV barns were 2.9C and 3.0C cooler than CB and NV barns, respectively. No differences were seen in bedding or bulk tank bacterial counts among the housing systems. Although CV barns had significantly higher aerial ammonia and a trend for higher hydrogen sulfide concentrations than NV and CB barns, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were below the threshold that would affect cow performance or human health.

Czech Journal of Animal Science. 51(3). 102-109. 	2006	Dembele, I., Spinka, M., Stehulova, I., Panama, J. and Firla, P.	Factors contributing to the incidence and prevalence of lameness on Czech dairy farms	Czech Journal of Animal Science				Twenty-four Czech dairy farms were visited to record the prevalence of lameness and identify the factors associated with high lameness prevalence at the farm level and/or increased lameness risk at the level of individual cows. All cows were checked for lameness and 40 cows/farm were examined for overgrown claws, cattle hygiene and skin lesions. The farm environment was scored between 1 (excellent) to 5 (very poor) in three different aspects: floor traction, cow care quality and housing quality. Data on hoof trimming schedules were obtained from farm managers. Lameness prevalence in farms ranged from 6 to 42% (median of 22%). At the farm level, slippery floor and poor animal care were associated with high lameness prevalence (Spearman correlations, P<0.05), and the proportion of cows with overgrown claws tended to be associated with it (P<0.10). The reported time schedules of hoof trimming (continuous trimming applied and time elapsed since the whole herd was trimmed) were unrelated to either the prevalence of overgrown claws or the prevalence of lameness. Within farms, cows with overgrown claws and dirty cows were at an increased risk of being lame (multiple logistic regression, P<0.05) and cows with skin lesions tended to be more lame (P<0.10). The risk of lameness had an inverted U-shape dependence on age (P<0.05) with cows at 7-8 years of age being the most endangered by lameness. It is concluded that there is a large potential for lameness reduction in Czech dairy farms through improvement of management, flooring and claw trimming. Dirty cows and cows with skin lesions should be given special attention since they are more likely to get lame.	51	3	102-109	English	Sub National	24		Czech Republic	Central Bohemia	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	For Czech dairy farms, no recent data on the prevalence of lameness have been published in the scientific literature, so the first aim of this study was to fill this gap and provide basic data on the current lameness frequency in a sample of 24 Czech dairy farms. As the second aim of this study, we focused on some of these management-related risk factors. The third aim of the study was to assess to what extent the proportion of cows with overgrown claws and the proportion of lame cows are affected by the trimming schedule, as reported by the farm managers.

One group of high-production multiparous cows was monitored on each farm, and data on management, facility and stall design, and the conditions of the hocks were collected. Focal cows [n=38+or-3 (mean+or-standard deviation)] were evaluated for hock injuries using a 3-point scale (where 1=healthy and 3=evidently swollen or severe injury). Measures associated with the proportion (logit-transformed) of cows having injuries (score 2) or severe injuries (score=3) at the univariable level were submitted to multivariable general linear models. In NE-US, overall hock injuries increased with the percentage of stalls with fecal contamination [odds ratio (OR)=1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-1.54, for a 10% increase], and with the use of sawdust as bedding (OR=3.47; CI=1.14-10.62), and decreased with deep bedding (i.e., at least 10 cm depth of any type of bedding; OR=0.05; CI=0.02-0.14), use of sand as bedding (OR=0.06; CI=0.02-0.15), bedding dry matter (DM) 83.9% (OR=0.08; CI=0.03-0.20), and access to pasture during the dry period (OR=0.17; CI=0.05-0.53). When these variables were submitted to a multivariable model, the presence of deep bedding was the only factor that remained significant, explaining 54% of the variation in overall injuries. Severe hock injuries increased with the use of automatic scrapers (OR=2.29; CI=1.11-4.71) and the percentage of stalls with fecal contamination (OR=1.14; CI=1.00-1.31, for a 10% increase), and decreased with sand bedding (OR=0.22; CI=0.10-0.49), deep bedding (OR=0.24; CI=0.11-0.52), bedding DM 83.9% (OR=0.28; CI=0.14-0.58), and access to pasture during the dry period (OR=0.42; CI=0.18-0.97). The final multivariable model, which explained 36% of the variation in severe hock injuries, included the use of automatic scrapers and deep bedding. In CA, stall stocking density (OR=1.41; CI=1.00-2.01, for a 10% increase) and poor bedding maintenance (OR=1.08; CI=1.01-1.16, for a 2.5-cm decrease in depth of deep-bedded stalls) were associated with an increase of overall and severe hock injuries, respectively. Deep-bedded and well-maintained stalls reduce the risk of hock injuries. Regional variation in risk factors for these injuries should be considered when formulating on-farm recommendations.	96	6	3758-3765	English	Sub National	38		United States of America	California	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim was to investigate the association between management and facility design factors and the prevalence of hock injuries in high-producing dairy cows in freestall herds in these 2 regions.	0.25	Mar-May 2010	38	38	1444	Holstein	N	Severe Hock Injuries	Odds ratio	8

Worldwide, there is considerable between-herd variation within individual foot lesion prevalence studies. This variation suggests that herd-level risk factors are important from a prevention perspective. The objective was to determine the effect of selected risk factors on the prevalence of 7 foot lesions in both tie-stall and free-stall housing systems. As part of a cross-sectional foot lesion study 5 hoof trimmers recorded lesions for all cows that were foot trimmed in a herd. In addition, they completed a risk factor questionnaire for each herd. The impact of specific risk factors was evaluated using separate multivariable models for both free-stall and tie-stall herds. The lesions evaluated were digital dermatitis, sole ulcer, sole hemorrhage, heel horn erosion, white line separations, white line abscess, and interdigital fibroma. Model types were selected based on herd-level lesion distribution. Detrimental risk factors identified in free-stall housing included increased alley scraping frequency (2.2- to 2.4-fold for sole ulcers) and trimming in summer or fall (-0.2-fold vs. spring and winter for digital dermatitis). Protective risk factors in free stalls included intermediate bedding depth (0.4-fold for 2.5 to 7.5 cm vs. more or less bedding for interdigital fibroma) and trimming heifers before calving (0.1-fold for white line abscess). In tie-stall herds no protective risk factors were identified. Detrimental risk factors for lesions in tie stalls included year-round access to outside areas (2.1-fold increase in digital dermatitis, 3.5-fold for white line separation, and 7.0-fold for interdigital fibroma vs. no or only seasonal exercise access), routine spraying of feet (2.0-fold increase in digital dermatitis), larger herds (3.0-fold increase in interdigital fibroma vs. <41 cow herds), and the use of wood bedding material (6.5-fold vs. straw bedding for interdigital fibroma). The risk factors identified need further evaluation to determine the temporal relationships, as well as whether the relationships with foot lesions are causal.	92	4	1404-1411	English	Sub National	38		Canada	Ontario	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The objective was to evaluate relationships between selected herd-level risk factors and foot lesion prevalence in Ontario tie-stall and free-stall dairy herds.	1.166666667	Mar 2004 to May 2005	38	38	2603	Holstein	N	Sole ulcer;Interdigital Fibroma	%	5

Higher sustainability performance of intensive grazing versus zero-grazing dairy systems	Agronomy for Sustainable Development	10.1007/s13593-011-0074-5			Although grazing of dairy cows is an integral part of dairy farming in many European countries, farmers today more often choose for zero-grazing systems, where cows are housed throughout the year. Some studies already compared grazing and zero-grazing systems for specific issues such as labor efficiency, environmental impact, or animal welfare. In our study, we perform a more integrated evaluation, considering relevant ecological, economic, and social aspects. This allows for a balanced and more complete comparison of the sustainability performance of the two production methods. We evaluated ten intensive grazing and ten zero-grazing specialized Flemish dairy farms on the use of nutrients and energy, productivity and profitability, labor input, and animal welfare. In addition, we put special effort in formulating useful management advice for farmers. Therefore, we combined a detailed analysis of the sustainability indicators with an intensive interaction and discussion with farmers and farm advisors. Results show that, on average, the zero-grazing farms performed significantly worse from an ecological and economic point of view. This fact is explained mainly due to a less efficient use of concentrates and byproducts. Social sustainability performance did not differ significantly between the two groups. As a result, the integrated sustainability performance was significantly lower for the zero-grazing group. This finding shows that a further shift from intensive grazing to zero-grazing can move dairy farming in Flanders further away from sustainability. An important advice to improve the ecological and economic performance of zero-grazing farms is to optimize cows' rations to include more forages and optimize forage production and use. More detailed site- and case-specific management advice for farmers of both groups was provided during a discussion meeting. We consider this an essential additional step to any sustainability evaluation, since progress can only be made when monitoring results are translated into practical measures.	32	3	629-638	English	Sub National	20		Belgium	Flemish Region	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim of our study is to evaluate the integrated sustainability performance of grazing versus zero- grazing dairy systems in Flanders, considering relevant economic, ecological, and social sustainability aspects.	0.75	Feb 2010-Oct 2010	20	20	1930	Holstein cross	N	Locomotion Difficulties;Dirty Legs/Flanks/Udders;Body condition;Lesions and swellings	%;Body Condition Score	6

Higher sustainability performance of intensive grazing versus zero-grazing dairy systems	Agronomy for Sustainable Development	10.1007/s13593-011-0074-5			Although grazing of dairy cows is an integral part of dairy farming in many European countries, farmers today more often choose for zero-grazing systems, where cows are housed throughout the year. Some studies already compared grazing and zero-grazing systems for specific issues such as labor efficiency, environmental impact, or animal welfare. In our study, we perform a more integrated evaluation, considering relevant ecological, economic, and social aspects. This allows for a balanced and more complete comparison of the sustainability performance of the two production methods. We evaluated ten intensive grazing and ten zero-grazing specialized Flemish dairy farms on the use of nutrients and energy, productivity and profitability, labor input, and animal welfare. In addition, we put special effort in formulating useful management advice for farmers. Therefore, we combined a detailed analysis of the sustainability indicators with an intensive interaction and discussion with farmers and farm advisors.

Both hind claws were inspected on six occasions (-40, 10, 35, 85, 120 and 210 days relative to calving) to determine the severity of 5 disorders (sole and white line area haemorrhages, white line disease, heel horn erosion, digital dermatitis and other lesions). Six aspects of locomotion ability (tracking, spine curvature, speed, head bobbing, general symmetry and abduction/adduction) were assessed from 1 (normal) to 5 (abnormal) every 2 weeks. Throughout the study records of clinical lameness were kept for all animals. Lying times of 26 block-paired cows (PASTURE n=13, HOUSED n=13) were recorded automatically every 5 min for 48 h at 33, 83 and 193 days post-calving. Data were analysed using mixed models for repeated measures, logistic regression and survival analysis, as appropriate. The severity of hoof disorders was lower for PASTURE compared to HOUSED cows from 85 days post-calving onwards (P<0.05). HOUSED cows had a greater hazard ratio (P<0.01) of presenting an abnormal (i.e. scoring 3) tracking (2.8), spine curvature (2.3), head bobbing (3.6), general symmetry (3.0), abduction/adduction (4.2) and for the average (3.9) of all locomotion aspects investigated (i.e. abnormal locomotion). Furthermore, HOUSED cows had a greater odds ratio (6.5, P<0.01) of clinical lameness from day 180 post-calving onwards. Mean total lying times per 48 h period were shorter (P<0.001) for HOUSED compared to PASTURE cows (18.1 h, SE 0.71 vs. 20.5 h, SE 0.73). In summary, from day 85 post-calving to the end of the production cycle PASTURE cows had less severe hoof disorders, better locomotion ability and reduced likelihood of clinical lameness compared to similar cows in a HOUSED system. The PASTURE system also facilitated longer, undisrupted lying times that have beneficial implications for lameness. A PASTURE system therefore improved cow welfare in terms of lameness compared to a HOUSED system.	125		199-207	English	Site Specific	1		Ireland		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The first objective of this study was to compare in a pasture-based system to an indoor production system (i.e. cubicle-housed systems) hoof disorders, locomotion ability, clinical lameness and lying times.

The aim of this research was to identify and compare housing and management factors associated with prevalence of lameness, prevalence of lesions or swellings, prevalence of dirty hindquarters, and frequency of displacements (social behavior) in dairy herds in free-stall housing. Seven observers collected data regarding housing and management characteristics of 179 Dutch dairy herds (herd size: 22-211 cows) in free-stall housing during winter. Lame cows, cows with lesions or swellings, and cows with dirty hindquarters were counted and occurrence of displacements was recorded during 120 min of observation. For each of the four welfare indicators, housing and management factors associated with the welfare indicator were selected in a succession of logistic or log-linear regression analyses. Prevalence of lameness was associated with surface of the lying area, summer pasturing, herd biosecurity status, and far-off and close-up dry cow groups (P<0.05). Prevalence of lesions or swellings was associated with surface of the lying area, summer pasturing, light intensity in the barn, and days in milk when the maximum amount of concentrates was fed (P<0.05). Prevalence of dirty hindquarters was associated with surface of the lying area, proportion of stalls with fecal contamination, head lunge impediments in stalls, and number of roughage types (P<0.05). Average frequency of displacements was associated with the time of introducing heifers in the lactating group, the use of cow brushes, continuous availability of roughage, floor scraping frequency, herd size, and the proportion cows to stalls (P<0.05). Prevalences of lameness and of lesions or swellings were lower in herds with soft mats or mattresses (odd ratio (OR)=0.66 and 0.58, confidence interval (CI)=0.48-0.91 and 0.39-0.85) or deep bedding (OR=0.48 and 0.48, CI=0.32-0.71 and 0.30-0.77) in stalls, compared with concrete, and in herds with summer pasturing (OR=0.68 and 0.41, CI=0.51-0.90 and 0.27-0.61), compared with zero-grazing. Deep bedding in stalls was negatively associated with prevalence of dirty hindquarters (OR=0.50, CI=0.29-0.86), compared with hard mats. It was concluded that some aspects of housing and management are common protective factors for prevalence of lameness, lesions or swellings, and dirty hindquarters, but not for frequency of displacements.	118	1	80-92	English	National	179		Netherlands		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim of this research was to 84 identify and compare housing and management factors associated with prevalence of lameness, prevalence of 85 lesions or swellings, prevalence of dirty hindquarters, and average frequency of displacements in dairy herds 86 with free-stall housing.	0.3333333333	Nov 2009-Mar 2010	179	179	NR	Holstein cross;Other crossbreds	N	Lameness (Unspecified);Lesions and swellings	%	7

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of grazing (G) vs. zero-grazing (ZG), level of milk production, and quality and type of housing system [free stalls (FS) and straw yards (SY)] on the prevalence of lameness and leg injuries in dairy cows. Observations were made on 37 commercial dairy farms across Great Britain. A single visit of 5 d duration was made to each farm. During this visit, lameness scores and the incidence of swellings, rubs, and injuries to hocks and knees were recorded on all the peak- or mid-lactation cows. Aspects of the quality of housing and management that were likely to affect foot and leg health were recorded. There were more lame cows on ZG farms (39 +/- 0.02%) than on grazing (G) farms (15 +/- 0.01%), and lameness scores were higher on FS farms compared with SY farms (0.25 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.01). Cows on SY farms had fewer hock and knee injuries compared with FS farms. The frequency of knee swellings was higher on ZG farms (0.31 +/- 0.02) than on G farms (0.15 +/- 0.01). Aspects of the free-stall design affected foot and leg health. The number of hock swellings increased with increasing stall gradient (0.16 +/- 0.01 with no slope vs. 0.39 +/- 0.02 at a 0 to 1.5% slope). There was an interaction between the length of the free-stall lunging space and the hip width of the cow, indicating that the incidence of lameness is generally highest on farms with small free stalls and heavy cows. High levels of milk production did not affect lameness or leg injury. The results indicate that housing cows throughout the year potentially has a detrimental effect on foot and leg health. However, good free-stall design may reduce lameness and leg lesions.	89	11	4259-4266	English	National	37		United Kingdom		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that extended periods of housing affect the prevalence of lameness and hock and knee injuries in dairy cattle on commercial dairy farms.	3.5	Nov 2000-Apr 2003	37	37	2724	Holstein cross;Holstein	N	Swelling;Lameness (Unspecified)	Wald Statistic	8

Fifty-four farms were visited once to collect facility measurements and observations, interview the dairy producer, and score cows for locomotion, hock lesions, and hygiene. Median number of AMS units/farm was 2 (interquartile range = 1; range = 1 to 8). Factors concerning labor were the most commonly cited reason by dairy producers for making the transition to the AMS; additional commonly cited factors were an improvement in lifestyle and human health. Number of cows fetched per AMS, or manually brought to the AMS if not milked voluntarily, was 4.7 ± 2.3 cows/AMS per day (8% of cows) for free traffic flow farms and 3.3 ± 1.8 cows/AMS per day (5% of cows) for guided traffic flow farms. Cow resting surface was significantly associated with prevalence of lameness and severe lameness. Farms with sand-bedded freestalls (17.2%) and bedded packs (17.4%) had significantly lower lameness prevalence (score ≥3 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = normal locomotion) than farms with mattress freestalls (30.5%), waterbeds (25.0%), and mattresses with access to pasture (22.6%). Farms with mattresses and access to pasture had similar lameness prevalence to farms with waterbeds, but were lower than farms with mattresses only. A somewhat similar result was found for severe lameness prevalence (score ≥4 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = normal locomotion); farms with sand-bedded freestalls (2.8%), bedded packs (0.0%), and mattress freestalls with access to pasture (1.5%) had significantly lower prevalence than farms with mattresses (7.1%) or waterbeds (10.8%). Severe hock lesion prevalence (score = 3 on a 1 to 3 scale, with 1 = normal, 3 = swelling) in herds with sand-bedded freestalls, waterbeds, and bedded packs were similar and significantly lower than the prevalence in mattress- based freestalls. Cows housed in sand-bedded freestalls had significantly lower prevalence of dirty cows (score = 3 or 3.5 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = clean) than those housed on mattresses and waterbeds, and had significantly lower prevalence of severely dirty cows (score = 4, 4.5 or 5 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = clean) than all other housing systems except waterbeds, which was similar. Manure removal system (manual, automatic, or slatted floor) was significantly associated with prevalence of severely dirty cows; farms with manual scrap- ing had lower prevalence of severely dirty cows than farms where alley scraping was practiced automatically or slatted floors were used. Dairy producers using AMS appeared to be successful with a variety of facility designs and management practices. Cow resting surface in AMS herds was associated with some animal health and welfare measurements.	101	9	8586-8594	English	Sub National	54		United States of America	Minnesota|Wisconsin	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	Cubicle characteristics such as cubicle dimensions or management factors such as cow-to-cubicle ratio could affect health and behaviour of dairy cows. The objective of this study was to estimate effects of cubicle characteristics on animal welfare indicators in dairy cattle. A total of 64 loose housing farms in Germany were assessed once during the winter housing period by one experienced assessor. Nearly 15% of the dairy cows had access to pasture during summer months for <6 h/day, whereas 85% were zero-grazing farms. Selected animal welfare indicators (duration of the lying down process, collisions of cows with cubicles, cows lying outside cubicles, cow cleanliness, integument alterations, lameness and subclinical mastitis incidence) of the Welfare Quality R protocol and cubicle characteristics such as cow-to-cubicle ratio and cubicle dimensions were recorded. Data were statistically analysed using a multiple linear regression approach. Pasture access and cubicle type were considered as potential influencing factors. Wider cubicles positively affected the proportion of dairy cows with dirty flanks (-18.5% per 10 cm increase) but increased the number of cows with severe integument alterations (+8.9% per 10 cm increase). Larger lying areas reduced the percentage of cows with dirty udders (-2.9% per 10 cm2 increase). Longer distances from neck rail to curb were associated with higher prevalence of cows with dirty flanks (+3.1% per 10 cm increase) and subclinical mastitis incidence (+1.2% per 10 cm increase). With increasing neck rail height, the duration of the lying down process (-0.1 s per 10% increase), the percentages of cows with dirty legs (-8.4% per 10 cm increase), dirty udders (-7.0% per 10 cm increase) and severe lameness (-3.0% per 10 cm increase) decreased. Compared with rubber mat-equipped cubicles, deep-bedded cubicles showed a reduction in the lying down duration (-0.8 s), percentages of cows with dirty legs (-34.2%), dirty udders (-30.5%) and lesions and swellings (-13.1%). Compared with farms that did not provide any summer grazing, pasture access was associated with an increase of cows with severe lameness (+5.6%). Contrastingly, the number of cows with subclinical mastitis incidence was lower when cows had access to pasture in summer (-5.4%). Findings of the present study indicate several associations between cubicle characteristics and animal welfare in dairy cattle. Bedding type was found as the most influencing factor in terms of health and behaviour. Results of this study are valuable for farmers to identify the optimal cubicle design and improve the animal welfare level.	0.33	Jun 2012-Sep 2012	54	54	NR	Holstein;Jersey	N	Severe Hock lesions;Lameness (Unspecified);Severe Lameness;Hygiene Score	%	6

Factors concerning labor were the most commonly cited reason by dairy producers for making the transition to the AMS; additional commonly cited factors were an improvement in lifestyle and human health. Number of cows fetched per AMS, or manually brought to the AMS if not milked voluntarily, was 4.7 ± 2.3 cows/AMS per day (8% of cows) for free traffic flow farms and 3.3 ± 1.8 cows/AMS per day (5% of cows) for guided traffic flow farms. Cow resting surface was significantly associated with prevalence of lameness and severe lameness. Farms with sand-bedded freestalls (17.2%) and bedded packs (17.4%) had significantly lower lameness prevalence (score ≥3 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = normal locomotion) than farms with mattress freestalls (30.5%), waterbeds (25.0%), and mattresses with access to pasture (22.6%). Farms with mattresses and access to pasture had similar lameness prevalence to farms with waterbeds, but were lower than farms with mattresses only. A somewhat similar result was found for severe lameness prevalence (score ≥4 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = normal locomotion); farms with sand-bedded freestalls (2.8%), bedded packs (0.0%), and mattress freestalls with access to pasture (1.5%) had significantly lower prevalence than farms with mattresses (7.1%) or waterbeds (10.8%). Severe hock lesion prevalence (score = 3 on a 1 to 3 scale, with 1 = normal, 3 = swelling) in herds with sand-bedded freestalls, waterbeds, and bedded packs were similar and significantly lower than the prevalence in mattress- based freestalls. Cows housed in sand-bedded freestalls had significantly lower prevalence of dirty cows (score = 3 or 3.5 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = clean) than those housed on mattresses and waterbeds, and had significantly lower prevalence of severely dirty cows (score = 4, 4.5 or 5 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = clean) than all other housing systems except waterbeds, which was similar. Manure removal system (manual, automatic, or slatted floor) was significantly associated with prevalence of severely dirty cows; farms with manual scrap- ing had lower prevalence of severely dirty cows than farms where alley scraping was practiced automatically or slatted floors were used. Dairy producers using AMS appeared to be successful with a variety of facility designs and management practices. Cow resting surface in AMS herds was associated with some animal health and welfare measurements.	101	9	8586-8594	English	Sub National	54		United States of America	Minnesota|Wisconsin	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	Cubicle characteristics such as cubicle dimensions or management factors such as cow-to-cubicle ratio could affect health and behaviour of dairy cows. The objective of this study was to estimate effects of cubicle characteristics on animal welfare indicators in dairy cattle. A total of 64 loose housing farms in Germany were assessed once during the winter housing period by one experienced assessor. Nearly 15% of the dairy cows had access to pasture during summer months for <6 h/day, whereas 85% were zero-grazing farms. Selected animal welfare indicators (duration of the lying down process, collisions of cows with cubicles, cows lying outside cubicles, cow cleanliness, integument alterations, lameness and subclinical mastitis incidence) of the Welfare Quality R protocol and cubicle characteristics such as cow-to-cubicle ratio and cubicle dimensions were recorded. Data were statistically analysed using a multiple linear regression approach. Pasture access and cubicle type were considered as potential influencing factors. Wider cubicles positively affected the proportion of dairy cows with dirty flanks (-18.5% per 10 cm increase) but increased the number of cows with severe integument alterations (+8.9% per 10 cm increase). Larger lying areas reduced the percentage of cows with dirty udders (-2.9% per 10 cm2 increase). Longer distances from neck rail to curb were associated with higher prevalence of cows with dirty flanks (+3.1% per 10 cm increase) and subclinical mastitis incidence (+1.2% per 10 cm increase). With increasing neck rail height, the duration of the lying down process (-0.1 s per 10% increase), the percentages of cows with dirty legs (-8.4% per 10 cm increase), dirty udders (-7.0% per 10 cm increase) and severe lameness (-3.0% per 10 cm increase) decreased. Compared with rubber mat-equipped cubicles, deep-bedded cubicles showed a reduction in the lying down duration (-0.8 s), percentages of cows with dirty legs (-34.2%), dirty udders (-30.5%) and lesions and swellings (-13.1%). Compared with farms that did not provide any summer grazing, pasture access was associated with an increase of cows with severe lameness (+5.6%). Contrastingly, the number of cows with subclinical mastitis incidence was lower when cows had access to pasture in summer (-5.4%). Findings of the present study indicate several associations between cubicle characteristics and animal welfare in dairy cattle. Bedding type was found as the most influencing factor in terms of health and behaviour. Results of this study are valuable for farmers to identify the optimal cubicle design and improve the animal welfare level.	0.33	Jun 2012-Sep 2012	54	54	NR	Holstein;Jersey	N	Severe Hock lesions;Lameness (Unspecified);Severe Lameness;Hygiene Score	%	6

Fifty-four farms were visited once to collect facility measurements and observations, interview the dairy producer, and score cows for locomotion, hock lesions, and hygiene. Median number of AMS units/farm was 2 (interquartile range = 1; range = 1 to 8). Factors concerning labor were the most commonly cited reason by dairy producers for making the transition to the AMS; additional commonly cited factors were an improvement in lifestyle and human health. Number of cows fetched per AMS, or manually brought to the AMS if not milked voluntarily, was 4.7 ± 2.3 cows/AMS per day (8% of cows) for free traffic flow farms and 3.3 ± 1.8 cows/AMS per day (5% of cows) for guided traffic flow farms. Cow resting surface was significantly associated with prevalence of lameness and severe lameness. Farms with sand-bedded freestalls (17.2%) and bedded packs (17.4%) had significantly lower lameness prevalence (score ≥3 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = normal locomotion) than farms with mattress freestalls (30.5%), waterbeds (25.0%), and mattresses with access to pasture (22.6%). Farms with mattresses and access to pasture had similar lameness prevalence to farms with waterbeds, but were lower than farms with mattresses only. A somewhat similar result was found for severe lameness prevalence (score ≥4 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = normal locomotion); farms with sand-bedded freestalls (2.8%), bedded packs (0.0%), and mattress freestalls with access to pasture (1.5%) had significantly lower prevalence than farms with mattresses (7.1%) or waterbeds (10.8%). Severe hock lesion prevalence (score = 3 on a 1 to 3 scale, with 1 = normal, 3 = swelling) in herds with sand-bedded freestalls, waterbeds, and bedded packs were similar and significantly lower than the prevalence in mattress- based freestalls. Cows housed in sand-bedded freestalls had significantly lower prevalence of dirty cows (score = 3 or 3.5 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = clean) than those housed on mattresses and waterbeds, and had significantly lower prevalence of severely dirty cows (score = 4, 4.5 or 5 on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = clean) than all other housing systems except waterbeds, which was similar. Manure removal system (manual, automatic, or slatted floor) was significantly associated with prevalence of severely dirty cows; farms with manual scrap- ing had lower prevalence of severely dirty cows than farms where alley scraping was practiced automatically or slatted floors were used. Dairy producers using AMS appeared to be successful with a variety of facility designs and management practices.

The objective of this study was to estimate effects of cubicle characteristics on animal welfare indicators in dairy cattle. A total of 64 loose housing farms in Germany were assessed once during the winter housing period by one experienced assessor. Nearly 15% of the dairy cows had access to pasture during summer months for <6 h/day, whereas 85% were zero-grazing farms. Selected animal welfare indicators (duration of the lying down process, collisions of cows with cubicles, cows lying outside cubicles, cow cleanliness, integument alterations, lameness and subclinical mastitis incidence) of the Welfare Quality R protocol and cubicle characteristics such as cow-to-cubicle ratio and cubicle dimensions were recorded. Data were statistically analysed using a multiple linear regression approach. Pasture access and cubicle type were considered as potential influencing factors. Wider cubicles positively affected the proportion of dairy cows with dirty flanks (-18.5% per 10 cm increase) but increased the number of cows with severe integument alterations (+8.9% per 10 cm increase). Larger lying areas reduced the percentage of cows with dirty udders (-2.9% per 10 cm2 increase). Longer distances from neck rail to curb were associated with higher prevalence of cows with dirty flanks (+3.1% per 10 cm increase) and subclinical mastitis incidence (+1.2% per 10 cm increase). With increasing neck rail height, the duration of the lying down process (-0.1 s per 10% increase), the percentages of cows with dirty legs (-8.4% per 10 cm increase), dirty udders (-7.0% per 10 cm increase) and severe lameness (-3.0% per 10 cm increase) decreased. Compared with rubber mat-equipped cubicles, deep-bedded cubicles showed a reduction in the lying down duration (-0.8 s), percentages of cows with dirty legs (-34.2%), dirty udders (-30.5%) and lesions and swellings (-13.1%). Compared with farms that did not provide any summer grazing, pasture access was associated with an increase of cows with severe lameness (+5.6%). Contrastingly, the number of cows with subclinical mastitis incidence was lower when cows had access to pasture in summer (-5.4%). Findings of the present study indicate several associations between cubicle characteristics and animal welfare in dairy cattle.

The objective of this study was to identify possible risk factors for poor cow hind limb cleanliness in Danish loose-housed, lactating dairy cows. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study of 1315 cows in 42 commercial Danish dairy herds with primarily Danish Holstein cows. The effect of four cow-level factors (parity, days in milk, daily lying time and lameness) and eight herd-level factors (herd size, milk production, milking system, floor type, access to pasture grazing, floor scraping frequency, hoof bathing frequency and hoof washing frequency) on the risk of having dirtier hind limbs were analysed using ordinal logistic regression fitting a proportional odds model. Cow hind limb cleanliness was scored using an ordinal score from 1 to 4: 1 being clean and 4 being covered in dirt. The odds ratios (ORs) estimated from the proportional odds model depict the effect of a risk factor on the odds of having a higher rather than a lower cleanliness score. First parity cows had an increased risk of being dirtier compared with third parity or older cows (OR=1.70). Compared with late lactation, early and mid lactation were associated with an increased risk of being dirtier (OR=2.07 and 1.33, respectively). Decreasing the daily time lying by 30 min was associated with an increased risk of being dirtier (OR=1.05). Furthermore, an increased risk of being dirtier was found in herds with no pasture access (OR=3.75).	5	10	1613-1619	English	National	42		Denmark		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for poor cow leg cleanliness in loose housing systems.	1.42	2005-2006	42	42	1315	Holstein cross;Other crossbreds;Jersey	N	Dirty legs	%	9

"Compost bedding" (CB) is an alternative way of loose-housing that is currently being implemented in many regions world-wide. It has verifiable positive effects on lactating cows, and it can be expected to be beneficial also for dried cows. The objective of the present study was to analyze the possible benefits of applying a CB system during the dry-period for the health (udder and uterine health), and for reproductive and productive performance during the following lactation of mature cows when compared to cows allocated on straw bedding. A total of 423 Holstein cows were randomly distributed at drying-off into a CB-Group (n=242) and a straw-bedded group (S-group; n=181). After calving, the management was the same for all cows. Data on milk yield, pregnancy after first insemination (P/FAI), somatic cell counts (SCC), incidence of clinical mastitis, metritis and cytological endometritis, and mortality/culling rate were recorded. While no differences in P/FAI and mortality rate, nor in the incidence of clinical metritis or endometritis between groups were detected, there did emerge positive effects of CB-systems on udder health [lower incidence of the first mastitis-cases, 22.1 vs. 35%; P=0.004, of second-mastitis cases, 6.8 vs. 15%; P=0.009, and a positive tendency in SCC (96.1+or-135.2 vs. 139.5+or-242.6 cells/L; P=0.08)]. Moreover, increased milk yield/cow during the first 100 days of the following lactation (3778+or-887 vs. 3538+or-991 L/lactation; P=0.011) and milk yield/day-in-milk (38.38+or-7.3 vs. 36.70+or-7.5 L/d; P=0.022) were observed. These findings, added to the saving of straw costs and waste disposal, encourage the implementation of CB-systems in dairy farms.	159		161-164	English	Site Specific	1		Spain	Eastern Spain	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The objective of the present study was to analyze the possible effects of using bedded-pack systems during the dry period on health (udder and uterine health), reproductive and productive performance during the following lactation of mature cows.	0.67	Jun-Feb	1	2	423	Holstein	N	SCC/SCS;Mastitis;Neutrophils (PMN);Metritis	%;SCC	8

Because the IRCM and distribution of mastitis-causing bacteria may show substantial geographic variation, the primary objective of this study was to determine regional pathogen-specific IRCM on Canadian dairy farms. Additionally, the association of pathogen-specific IRCM with bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC) and barn type were determined. In total, 106 dairy farms in 10 provinces of Canada participated in the study for a period of 1 yr. Participating producers recorded 3,149 cases of clinical mastitis. The most frequently isolated mastitis pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus uberis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Overall mean and median IRCM were 23.0 and 16.7 cases per 100 cow-years in the selected herds, respectively, with a range from 0.7 to 97.4 per herd. No association between BMSCC and overall IRCM was found, but E. coli and culture-negative IRCM were highest and Staph. aureus IRCM was lowest in low and medium BMSCC herds. Staphylococcus aureus, Strep. uberis, and Bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus dysgalactiae IRCM were lowest in the Western provinces. Staphylococcus aureus and Strep. dysgalactiae IRCM were highest in Quebec. Cows in tie-stalls had higher incidences of Staph. aureus, Strep. uberis, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and other streptococcal IRCM compared with those in free-stalls, whereas cows in free stalls had higher Klebsiella spp. and E. coli IRCM than those in tie-stall barns. The focus of mastitis prevention and control programs should differ between regions and should be tailored to farms based on housing type and BMSCC.	91	4	1366-1377	English	Sub National	59		Canada	Southern Ontario	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	Our objective in this study was thus to examine cow comfort and behavior in lactating dairy cows kept in three different types of loose housing systems on the same farm: compost bedded pack (CBP), conventional bedded pack (BP) and freestalls (FS).	1.17	Mar 2011-May 2012	59	59	5395	Holstein cross;Jersey;Ayrshire;Brown Swiss;Montbéliarde;Other crossbreds	N	Mastitis	Incidence Rate	7

The most frequently isolated mastitis pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus uberis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Overall mean and median IRCM were 23.0 and 16.7 cases per 100 cow-years in the selected herds, respectively, with a range from 0.7 to 97.4 per herd. No association between BMSCC and overall IRCM was found, but E. coli and culture-negative IRCM were highest and Staph. aureus IRCM was lowest in low and medium BMSCC herds. Staphylococcus aureus, Strep. uberis, and Bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus dysgalactiae IRCM were lowest in the Western provinces. Staphylococcus aureus and Strep. dysgalactiae IRCM were highest in Quebec. Cows in tie-stalls had higher incidences of Staph. aureus, Strep. uberis, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and other streptococcal IRCM compared with those in free-stalls, whereas cows in free stalls had higher Klebsiella spp. and E. coli IRCM than those in tie-stall barns. The focus of mastitis prevention and control programs should differ between regions and should be tailored to farms based on housing type and BMSCC.	91	4	1366-1377	English	Sub National	59		Canada	Southern Ontario	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	Our objective in this study was thus to examine cow comfort and behavior in lactating dairy cows kept in three different types of loose housing systems on the same farm: compost bedded pack (CBP), conventional bedded pack (BP) and freestalls (FS).	1.17	Mar 2011-May 2012	59	59	5395	Holstein cross;Jersey;Ayrshire;Brown Swiss;Montbéliarde;Other crossbreds	N	Mastitis	Incidence Rate	7

Because the IRCM and distribution of mastitis-causing bacteria may show substantial geographic variation, the primary objective of this study was to determine regional pathogen-specific IRCM on Canadian dairy farms. Additionally, the association of pathogen-specific IRCM with bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC) and barn type were determined.

The influence of climatic conditions on physiological and behavioural parameters in dairy cows kept in open stables	Animal Science				This study aimed to assess whether cows are able to cope with the range of climatic conditions they are exposed to in open stables on commercial farms in central Europe. On each of four farms, ten lactating cows were observed over a total of five weeks in winter, spring and summer. Based on continuous measurements of air temperature (-13.8 to 28.7 degrees C) and relative air humidity (0.26 to 0.99), a mean value of a temperature humidity index (THI) was calculated for each farm and each observation day for night and day. THI had significant effects on skin temperature and body surface temperature (infrared thermography) both during night and day. Rectal temperature, duration of lying and cortisol concentration in the milk was significantly affected by THI during the day but not during the night. Heart rate and frequency of lying did not significantly covary with THI. Differences between farms and interactions between THI and farm were significant for most parameters. These results suggest that the climatic conditions during the day induced stronger thermoregulatory responses than the conditions during the night. Within the measured range of climatic conditions the cows were hardly exposed to severe cold or heat stress.	78	1	139-147	English	National	4		Switzerland		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of a wide range of climatic conditions ranging from cold in winter to heat in summer on physiological and behavioural parameters in lactating cows kept on Swiss farms.	0.75	Dec 1998-Aug 1999	4	4	76	Brown Swiss;Holstein cross	N	Cortisol levels	mmol/l	8

This is indicated by restrictions in the movements of the elbow and hock joints and in less fetlock joint flexion at full support.	29	S23	106-109	English	Site Specific	1		Sweden		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim was to analyse the movements of multiparous dairy cows as influenced by housing and summer grazing respectively, by use of high speed filming.	0.5	Apr 1997-Aug 1997	1	4	17	Friesian	Y	Locomotion Difficulties	#	7

Longevity of Swiss Brown cattle in different housing systems in Switzerland	Livestock Science	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livprodsci.2005.10.023			A Weibull mixed survival model was used to study the effect of a change in the housing system on length of productive life (LPL) in dairy cows. The data set included records on 71,469 Swiss Brown cows in 1674 farms in eastern and central Switzerland. About 36% of the records were right-censored. The observation period lasted from January 1, 1988 to May 1, 2001. During this period, 517 farms changed their housing conditions from a tie-stall barn to a loose housing system. Besides a random time-dependent effect of herd-year-season, the model included fixed effects of housing system, lactation number and stage of lactation, within herd and parity production level (all time-dependent), and age at first calving (time-independent). All effects had a significant effect on LPL at a level of p<0.001. Cows in loose housing systems showed the lowest risk ratios of being culled (0.93) compared to the reference system tie-stall barn (1.00). The highest relative culling rate (1.09) was observed within the changing period from tie-stall barn to loose housing system. Within the first three lactations, the relative culling risk increased stepwise with lactation stage. The hazard slightly increased from first until lactation number 8 and higher. The relative culling rates were highest (2.22) for cows yielding less than 90% compared to herd-mates of the same lactation number, whereas the lowest risk ratios were estimated for animals yielding more than 110% compared to their reference group (0.64). When heifers were older than 3 years at first calving, there was a tendency towards a higher relative culling risk (1.06).	101		134-141	English	Sub National	1674		Switzerland		Empirical	Quantitative	BACI	The objective of this investigation was to analyse the influence of systematic environmental effects on LPL of Swiss Brown cows.

Five herds were zero-grazed, while in the other five herds cows and youngstock had access to pasture during the summer. Twenty female calves <1 year of age and 20 females between 1 and 2 years of age were randomly selected on each farm, and were individually monitored at 3 monthly intervals for 2 years. Data from 366 animals with at least five observations were analysed using linear mixed models with a binomial error distribution. Independent variables were grazing, age, month of observation and previous occurrence of the disorder, while herd and animal were included as random effects. Of these 366 animals, 287 had calved once and 76 twice at the end of the study. Analytic results were obtained for digital dermatitis (DD), interdigital dermatitis/heel horn erosion (IDHE) and sole haemorrhages (SH), all of which had a prevalence of >15%. The prevalence of DD increased considerably around first calving on both the grazing and the zero-grazing farms. The prevalence of IDHE increased with age while SH prevalence showed a more fluctuating pattern. Digital dermatitis was less frequently observed in pastured animals than in permanently housed animals (OR=0.12-0.64 depending on month of observation; P<0.05), with the strongest effect being seen during the period when the herds which grazed cattle actually had animals at pasture (May to August). Grazing was also associated with lower levels of IDHE and SH, again particularly during the grazing season. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study assessed dairy cow welfare through the application of the Italian National Animal Welfare Reference Center (CReNBA) checklist in 36 dairy farms located in Ragusa (Italy) subjected to two different management conditions, housing with free access to pasture (Group 1, farms n = 17) and indoor housing (Group 2, farms n = 19). Five areas of investigation were considered: Area A, "Farm management and personnel"; Area B, "Facilities and equipment"; Area C, "Animal-based measures"; Area D, "Inspection of microclimatic environmental conditions and alarm systems"; and Area E, "Biosecurity". Blood samples were collected by coccygeal venipuncture from all animals (4081 cows). The specific antibodies against Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Chlamydophila abortus, Neospora caninum, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and the bovine herpesvirus were assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) serological test. Group 1 (access to pasture) showed a lower value of percentage score recorded in Area A (p = 0.02) and E (p = 0.01) than Group 2 (indoor housing). Herpesvirus (Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis - IBR - detection of gB antibodies/IBR-gB) blood concentrations were higher in the cows housed indoor versus those with access to pasture (p = 0.01). Farm management and personnel (score A) was correlated with the level of bovine viral diarrhea virus (τ = 0.3754) and bovine-herpesvirus-specific antibodies (IBR-gB) (τ = 0.4159). "Biosecurity" percentage score showed a significant correlation with Chlamydophila abortus (τ = -0.4621) in the cows with access to pasture and IBR-gB (τ = 0.3435) in the cows housed fully indoors. Group 2 showed a significantly reduced level of antibodies against Neospora caninum. In conclusion, differences in the welfare assessment score were observed in the "Farm management and personnel" and "Biosecurity" between the two management conditions. It had an effect on the prevalence of herpesvirus, which occurred more in cattle with access to pasture. Therefore, an accurate application of the checklist could be an instrument to prevent and control the spread of infections in farms.	11	11		English	Sub National	36		Italy	Ragusa	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim of this study was to assess welfare levels through the application of CReNBA’s checklist (File S1) on dairy farms with two different management conditions, and to compare the obtained results with the prevalence of various infectious diseases.

To this aim, an experiment was carried out inside a free-stall dairy house equipped with two different cooling systems: a fogging system associated with forced ventilation in the resting area and a sprinkler system associated with forced ventilation in the feeding alley. The experiment regarded two adjacent pens of the barn and was constituted by three different trials carried out in the following periods: 27th June - 7th July (P1), 25th July - 4th August (P2), 24th August - 3rd September (P3). The experimental protocol of each trial required that the treatment group was housed in one pen where the two cooling systems were always activated following an established timetable, whereas the control group was housed in the other pen, where the sprinkler system associated with forced ventilation was always deactivated. Climatic parameters were measured inside each pen of the barn and outside. Then, thermal humidity index (THI) was calculated. Rectal temperature and respiration rate of a sample of dairy cows were monitored each day during the three periods considered (P1, P2 and P3). During the three trials the cows of both groups were subjected to climatic conditions that resulted in average daily THI values between 72.8 and 74.7, corresponding to mild or moderate heat stress. However, during daytime, air temperature and relative humidity reached values corresponding to a severe heat stress, as attested by the maximum THI values that were higher than or very close to 80. Furthermore, it was observed that the sprinklers do not influence the microclimatic conditions. However, the physiological parameters values of the treatment group were always significantly lower than the corresponding ones of the control group. Specifically, the system especially influenced the respiration rate that, in the treatment group, was close to 50 breath/min, while in the control group it reached 70 breath/min. The sprinkler system had more limited effects on rectal temperature that, however, in the treatment group was significantly lower than in the control group (38.7°C to 38.8°C vs 39.1°C to 39.4°C) in all the three periods of the experiment. These results show that the sprinkler system could be useful to mitigate heat stress in dairy cows. © A.

Epub 2013 Sep 17.			The elimination of misclassification bias introduced by multiple observers was evaluated and discussed based on an illustrative example using lameness prevalence in 80 Danish dairy herds. Data from 5073 cows from loose-housed cubicle herds larger than 100 cows were included in the analysis. Four trained observers performed clinical scoring on cow level and undertook a calibration test with 39 video sequences. The calibration test served both the purpose of estimating inter-observer agreement (PABAK. = 0.69) in accordance with previous results and to estimate the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) for each observer. In the absence of a gold standard for the clinical observations, a latent class analysis (LCA) evaluating the true within-herd lameness prevalence was used. Sensitivity amongst observers was fairly low (0.24-0.81) inducing a general underestimation of the true prevalence. Comparative analyses were made to assess the effect of grazing on the lameness prevalence in order to demonstrate the consequences of using unadjusted apparent prevalences (AP) compared to the true prevalences (TP). Lameness prevalence was higher in grazing herds using AP estimates (19.0% zero-grazing, 20.2% grazing); while the TP estimates showed the expected higher lameness prevalence in zero-grazing herds (42.3% vs. 35.9%).

Peripartum health and welfare of Holstein-Friesian cows in a confinement-TMR system compared to a pasture-based system	Animal Welfare		0962-7286	http://www.ufaw.org.uk/animal.php	The greatest challenge to the welfare of dairy cows occurs in the peripartum period. Given the perception that cow welfare is better in more natural environments, it was hypothesised that cows in a PASTURE-based production system (cubicle housing with grass silage prepartum and rotational grazing with concentrate supplementation post-partum) would have improved peripartum welfare compared to cows in a HOUSED production system (cubicle housing with a total mixed ration [TMR], prepartum and postpartum). Blood samples were analysed for acute phase proteins (APP), cortisol, white blood cell (WBC) differential and counts and other biochemical metabolites as non-specific indicators of sub-clinical ill-health and nutritional stress. Daily monitoring of rectal temperature (RT) and rumen fill (RF) scores were used to monitor ill-health and nutritional status. Reproductive health and welfare (calving difficulty, retained placenta, puerperal metritis, endometritis and oestrous cyclicity) was also recorded. No differences were found between treatments for APP, cortisol or WBC. Blood metabolite differences indicated that PASTURE cows were under greater nutritional stress than HOUSED cows. HOUSED cows showed an increase in RF score from day 0 to 10 postpartum and had a higher RF score than PASTURE cows. PASTURE cows had an overall lower RT and lower incidence of reproductive disorders. Results primarily reflect nutritional differences between treatments with PASTURE cows showing greater potential nutritional/metabolic stress in early lactation which has attendant implications for welfare. Nevertheless, this did not result in inferior health and, in accordance with our hypothesis, PASTURE cows' reproductive health and welfare tended to be better than that of HOUSED cows.	18	4	467-476	English	Site Specific	1		Ireland	County Cork	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	We hypothesised that cows in the pasture-based system would have better sub-clinical and clinical health (acute phase proteins and haematological profile, indicative of an optimal inflammatory response as well as rectal temperature and better health records), nutritional status (greater rumen fill and reduced metabolite alterations) and reproductive health and welfare (lower incidence of calving difficulty, retained placenta, puerperal metritis and endometritis as well as faster recovery of oestrous cyclicity) than cows in a confinement system during the peripartum and early lactation periods.

The objectives of this study were to determine prevalence of lameness and investigate cow-and herd-level factors associated with lameness in dairy cows housed in freestall barns in 3 Canadian provinces. A purposive sample of 40 Holstein-Friesian cows was selected from each of 141 dairy farms in Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta. In total, 5,637 cows were scored once for lameness (presence of limping when walking). Data collected included information on individual cows (hock lesions, claw length, body condition score, parity, days in milk, and milk production), management practices (floor and stall cleaning routine, bedding routine, and footbath practices), and facility design (stall dimensions, stall base and bedding type, width of feed alley, flooring type, and slipperiness) hypothesized to be risk factors for lameness. Multilevel mixed logistic regression models were constructed (including farm as a random effect and province as a fixed effect). Herd-level lameness prevalence ranged from 0 to 69% (mean = 21%). Lameness prevalence increased with increasing parity; compared with first parity, cows in parity 2, 3, and >= 4 had 1.6, 3.3, and 4 times, respectively, higher odds of being lame. Furthermore, the odds of lameness were 1.6 times greater in cows with low body condition score (<= 2.5) than in cows with a higher body condition score. In addition, injured hocks and overgrown claws were associated with 1.4- and 1.7-fold increased odds of being lame, respectively, whereas every 1 kg increase in daily milk production was associated with a 3% decrease in the odds of being lame. Lameness prevalence was higher in herds with <= 100 cows, but lower in barns with a sand or dirt stall base, or with bedding >= 2 cm deep. Cows exposed to very slippery floors had 2 times the odds of being lame compared with cows exposed to non slippery floors. We attributed the wide range of lameness prevalence to the great variability in facilities and management practices among farms. Finally, we inferred that the prevalence of lameness could be decreased by improving management of multiparous, thin, or injured cows and by adopting management practices intended to improve cow comfort, namely the floor's slip resistance and the stall's lying surface.	98	10	6978-6991	English	National	141		Canada	Quebec|Ontario|Alberta	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	To determine (1) prevalence of lameness, (2) herd-level management and facility design factors related to lameness prevalence, and (3) the association between herd and cow-level factors, as related to the prevalence of lameness.	1.25	May 2011-Jul 2012	141	NR	40	Holstein cross	N	Lameness (Unspecified)	%	8

The objectives of this study were to determine prevalence of lameness and investigate cow-and herd-level factors associated with lameness in dairy cows housed in freestall barns in 3 Canadian provinces. A purposive sample of 40 Holstein-Friesian cows was selected from each of 141 dairy farms in Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta. In total, 5,637 cows were scored once for lameness (presence of limping when walking). Data collected included information on individual cows (hock lesions, claw length, body condition score, parity, days in milk, and milk production), management practices (floor and stall cleaning routine, bedding routine, and footbath practices), and facility design (stall dimensions, stall base and bedding type, width of feed alley, flooring type, and slipperiness) hypothesized to be risk factors for lameness. Multilevel mixed logistic regression models were constructed (including farm as a random effect and province as a fixed effect). Herd-level lameness prevalence ranged from 0 to 69% (mean = 21%). Lameness prevalence increased with increasing parity; compared with first parity, cows in parity 2, 3, and >= 4 had 1.6, 3.3, and 4 times, respectively, higher odds of being lame. Furthermore, the odds of lameness were 1.6 times greater in cows with low body condition score (<= 2.5) than in cows with a higher body condition score. In addition, injured hocks and overgrown claws were associated with 1.4- and 1.7-fold increased odds of being lame, respectively, whereas every 1 kg increase in daily milk production was associated with a 3% decrease in the odds of being lame. Lameness prevalence was higher in herds with <= 100 cows, but lower in barns with a sand or dirt stall base, or with bedding >= 2 cm deep. Cows exposed to very slippery floors had 2 times the odds of being lame compared with cows exposed to non slippery floors. We attributed the wide range of lameness prevalence to the great variability in facilities and management practices among farms.

Producer estimates of prevalence and perceived importance of lameness in dairy herds with tiestalls, freestalls, and automated milking systems	Journal of Dairy Science	https://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-13008		https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030217309025;http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=med14&NEWS=N&AN=28987585	Lameness is one of the most important welfare and productivity concerns in the dairy industry. Our objectives were to obtain producers' estimates of its prevalence and their perceptions of lameness, and to investigate how producers monitor lameness in tiestall (TS), freestall with milking parlor (FS), and automated milking system (AMS) herds. Forty focal cows per farm in 237 Canadian dairy herds were scored for lameness by trained researchers. On the same day, the producers completed a questionnaire. Mean herd-level prevalence of lameness estimated by producers was 9.0% (+/-0.9%; +/-SE), whereas the researchers observed a mean prevalence of 22.2% (+/-0.9%). Correlation between producer- and researcher-estimated lameness prevalence was low (r = 0.19) and mean researcher prevalence was 1.6, 1.8, and 4.1 times higher in AMS, FS, and TS farms, respectively. A total of 48% of producers thought lameness was a moderate or major problem in their herds (TS = 34%; AMS =53%; FS = 59%). One third of producers considered lameness the highest ranked health problem they were trying to control, whereas two-thirds of producers (TS = 43%; AMS = 63%; FS = 71%) stated that they had made management changes to deal with lameness in the past 2 yr. Almost all producers (98%) stated they routinely check cows to identify new cases of lameness; however, 40% of producers did not keep records of lameness (AMS = 24%; FS = 23%; TS = 60%). A majority (69%) of producers treated lame cows themselves immediately after detection, whereas 13% relied on hoof-trimmer or veterinarians to plan treatment. Producers are aware of lameness as an issue in dairy herds and almost all monitor lameness as part of their daily routine. However, producers underestimate lameness prevalence, which highlights that lameness detection continues to be difficult in in all housing systems, especially in TS herds. Training to improve detection, record keeping, identification of farm-specific risk factors, and treatment planning for lame cows is likely to help decrease lameness prevalence.

To better control environmental mastitis, we need an improved understanding of the relationships among bedding selection and management, bedding bacteria counts (BBC), and udder health (UH). The objectives of this cross-sectional observational study were (1) to describe BBC, bedding characteristics, udder hygiene scores, bulk tank milk (BTM) quality, and UH in US dairy herds using 1 of 4 bedding materials; (2) describe the relationship between BBC and herd measures of UH; and (3) identify benchmarks for monitoring bedding hygiene. Local dairy veterinarians and university researchers enrolled and sampled 168 herds from 17 states. Herds were on a Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) testing program and used 1 of 4 bedding types for lactating cows: new sand, reclaimed sand, manure solids (MNS), or organic non-manure materials. Each herd was sampled twice (winter and summer) in 2016. Samples and data collected included unused and used bedding, BTM samples, udder hygiene scores, DHIA test data, and descriptions of facilities and herd management practices. Bedding was cultured to determine the total bacteria count and counts of Bacillus spp., Bacterial pathogens - Coliforms, Klebsiella spp., non-coliform gram-negative organisms, streptococci or streptococci-like organisms (SSLO), and Staphylococcus spp. Bedding dry matter, organic matter, and pH were also measured. Bulk tank milk samples were cultured to determine counts of Bacterial pathogens - Coliforms, NAS, SSLO, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma spp. Udder health measures included DHIA test-day average linear score (LS); the proportion of cows with an intramammary infection (IMI), where infection was defined as LS >=4.0; the proportion of cows with a new IMI, where new IMI was defined as LS changing from <4.0 to >=4.0 in the last 2 tests; the proportion of cows with a chronic infection, where chronic was defined as LS >=4.0 on the last 2 tests; and the cumulative incidence of clinical mastitis in the 30-d period preceding sample collection. Although much variation existed within and among bedding types, mixed linear regression showed the use of MNS bedding to be generally associated with higher BBC, dirtier udders, increased coliform and SSLO counts in BTM, and poorer UH measures compared with organic non-manure materials, reclaimed sand, or new sand bedding materials. While controlling for important farm traits and management practices, mixed linear regression showed that increased counts of Bacterial pathogens - Coliforms, Klebsiella spp., SSLO, and Staphylococcus spp. in both unused and used bedding were associated with poorer values for 1 or more herd-level measures of UH. Achievable benchmarks identified for counts of Bacterial pathogens - Coliforms (unused: <=500 cfu/cm3; used: <=10,000 cfu/cm3), Klebsiella spp. (0 cfu/cm3 for unused and used), Staphylococcus spp. (0 cfu/cm3 for unused and used), and SSLO (unused: 0 cfu/cm3; used: <=500,000 cfu/cm3) can be used to monitor bedding hygiene in most bedding materials, with minor variations suggested for SSLO in unused MNS (<=1,000 cfu/cm3).

Achievable benchmarks identified for counts of Bacterial pathogens - Coliforms (unused: <=500 cfu/cm3; used: <=10,000 cfu/cm3), Klebsiella spp. (0 cfu/cm3 for unused and used), Staphylococcus spp. (0 cfu/cm3 for unused and used), and SSLO (unused: 0 cfu/cm3; used: <=500,000 cfu/cm3) can be used to monitor bedding hygiene in most bedding materials, with minor variations suggested for SSLO in unused MNS (<=1,000 cfu/cm3).

To better control environmental mastitis, we need an improved understanding of the relationships among bedding selection and management, bedding bacteria counts (BBC), and udder health (UH). The objectives of this cross-sectional observational study were (1) to describe BBC, bedding characteristics, udder hygiene scores, bulk tank milk (BTM) quality, and UH in US dairy herds using 1 of 4 bedding materials; (2) describe the relationship between BBC and herd measures of UH; and (3) identify benchmarks for monitoring bedding hygiene. Local dairy veterinarians and university researchers enrolled and sampled 168 herds from 17 states. Herds were on a Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) testing program and used 1 of 4 bedding types for lactating cows: new sand, reclaimed sand, manure solids (MNS), or organic non-manure materials. Each herd was sampled twice (winter and summer) in 2016. Samples and data collected included unused and used bedding, BTM samples, udder hygiene scores, DHIA test data, and descriptions of facilities and herd management practices. Bedding was cultured to determine the total bacteria count and counts of Bacillus spp., Bacterial pathogens - Coliforms, Klebsiella spp., non-coliform gram-negative organisms, streptococci or streptococci-like organisms (SSLO), and Staphylococcus spp. Bedding dry matter, organic matter, and pH were also measured. Bulk tank milk samples were cultured to determine counts of Bacterial pathogens - Coliforms, NAS, SSLO, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma spp. Udder health measures included DHIA test-day average linear score (LS); the proportion of cows with an intramammary infection (IMI), where infection was defined as LS >=4.0; the proportion of cows with a new IMI, where new IMI was defined as LS changing from <4.0 to >=4.0 in the last 2 tests; the proportion of cows with a chronic infection, where chronic was defined as LS >=4.0 on the last 2 tests; and the cumulative incidence of clinical mastitis in the 30-d period preceding sample collection. Although much variation existed within and among bedding types, mixed linear regression showed the use of MNS bedding to be generally associated with higher BBC, dirtier udders, increased coliform and SSLO counts in BTM, and poorer UH measures compared with organic non-manure materials, reclaimed sand, or new sand bedding materials.

Feeding systems and replicates included both Jersey and Holstein cows. Cows in confinement were fed a total mixed ration, and cows on pasture were supplemented with concentrates and provided baled hay or haylage when pasture supply was limiting. Breeding periods were for 75 d in spring or fall. Reproductive performance did not differ significantly due to feeding system or season.

Cows in confinement had 1.8 times more clinical mastitis and eight times the rate of culling for mastitis than did cows on pasture. Jerseys had half as many clinical cases of mastitis per cow as Holsteins. Only 41 ± 5% of confinement Holsteins remained for a subsequent lactation, starting within the defined calving season compared with 51 ± 5% of pastured Holsteins and 71 and 72 ± 5% of Jerseys, respectively.

In summary, pastured cows had fewer clinical cases of mastitis, lower body condition scores, and lower body weights than confinement cows.

Feeding systems and replicates included both Jersey and Holstein cows. Cows in confinement were fed a total mixed ration, and cows on pasture were supplemented with concentrates and provided baled hay or haylage when pasture supply was limiting. Breeding periods were for 75 d in spring or fall. Reproductive performance did not differ significantly due to feeding system or season. Jerseys had higher conception rates (59.6 vs. 49.5 ± 3.3%) and higher percentages of cows pregnant in 75 d (78.1 vs. 57.9 ± 3.9%) than Holsteins. Cows in confinement had 1.8 times more clinical mastitis and eight times the rate of culling for mastitis than did cows on pasture. Jerseys had half as many clinical cases of mastitis per cow as Holsteins. Only 41 ± 5% of confinement Holsteins remained for a subsequent lactation, starting within the defined calving season compared with 51 ± 5% of pastured Holsteins and 71 and 72 ± 5% of Jerseys, respectively. Body weights and condition scores were generally higher for confinement cows than pastured cows, and Jerseys had higher condition scores and lower body weights than Holsteins. In summary, pastured cows had fewer clinical cases of mastitis, lower body condition scores, and lower body weights than confinement cows. Holsteins were less likely to rebreed, had more mastitis, higher culling rates, and lower body condition scores than Jerseys.	85	1	105-111	English	Site Specific	1		United States of America		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The specific objective of this study was to examine differences in reproduction, udder health, and BCS among cows managed in a confinement system compared with cows managed on pasture.	3.5	Mar 1995-Nov 1998	1	4	144	Holstein;Jersey	N	Mastitis;Mortality	%	7

Our objective was to evaluate a diversified sample of cow- and herd-related risk factors for DD in dairy cows housed in cubicle houses with different flooring systems. Associations were analysed in random-effects logistic-regression models using 2,134 cows (37 herds) and 2,892 cows (47 herds) in the pasture and housing studies, respectively. At cow-level, the odds of having DD were increased in the case of lower parity and lactation. Important risk factors at herd-level were: restricted grazing time, fast rise in concentrate amount after calving, feeding by-products, herd trimming only at long intervals, and introduction of dry cows into the lactating herd before calving. The odds for DD were lower if cows were housed on a slatted floor with manure scraper and provided long and wide cubicles, and if calves were reared in the dairy cows' accommodation.	71	44593	11-21	English	National	47		Netherlands		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	Our purpose of this study was to re-evaluate a diverse sample of cow- and herd-related risk factors for DD both during the pasturing and housing season on Dutch dairy farms with loose housing and different flooring systems.	0.83	Sep 1999-Jun 2000	NR	47	2892	Holstein;Holstein cross	N	Digital Dermatitis	%	7

The study was conducted on 18 commercial dairy farms, 6 of each housing type, in Minnesota and eastern South Dakota. The primary breed in all farms was Holstein; 1 CV and 1 NV herd had approximately 30% Jersey-Holstein crossbreds. All freestall herds used sand for bedding. Farms were visited 4 times (once in each season) between January and November 2008, and approximately 93% of all animals in each pen were visually scored on each visit. Outcome-based measurements of welfare (locomotion, hock lesions, body condition score, hygiene, respiration rates, mortality, and mastitis prevalence) were collected on each farm. Lameness prevalence (proportion of cows with locomotion score 3 on a 1 to 5 scale, where 1=normal and 5=severely lame) in CB barns (4.4%) was lower than that in NV (15.9%) and CV (13.1%) barns. Lameness prevalence was similar between CV and NV barns. Hock lesion prevalence (proportion of cows with a lesion score 2 on a 1 to 3 scale, where 1=normal, 2=hair loss, and 3=swelling) was lower in CB barns (3.8%) than in CV (31.2%) and NV barns (23.9%). Hygiene scores (1 to 5 scale, where 1=clean and 5=very dirty) were higher for CB (3.18) than CV (2.83) and NV (2.77) barns, with no differences between CV and NV barns. Body condition scores, respiration rates, mastitis prevalence, culling, and mortality rates did not differ among housing systems. The CV and NV barns were evaluated using the cow comfort index (proportion of cows lying down in a stall divided by all animals touching a stall) and the stall usage index (proportion of cows lying divided by all animals in the pen not eating). The CV barns tended to have greater cow comfort index (85.9%) than the NV barns (81.4%) and had greater stall usage index (76.8% and 71.5%, respectively). Dairy cattle housed in CB barns had reduced lameness and hock lesions compared with those housed in freestall barns and had no adverse associations with body condition, respiration rates, mastitis prevalence, culling, or mortality. When comparing the 2 freestall housing options, CV barns had improved cow comfort indices compared with NV barns. Although cows in CB barns had better feet and leg health, as indicated by the reduced lameness and hock lesion prevalence, acquiring bedding and managing the bedded pack could limit their use.	94	11	5469-5479	English	Sub National	2		United States of America	Minnesota|South Dakota	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The objective of this cohort study was to investigate animal welfare in 2 newer dairy housing options in the upper Midwest, cross-ventilated freestall barns (CV) and compost-bedded-pack barns (CB), compared with conventional, naturally ventilated freestall barns (NV).	0.92	January-Nov 2008	18	18	NR	Holstein;Holstein cross	N	Hock lesions (Unspecified);Lameness (Unspecified);Body condition	%;Body Condition Score	8

Outcome-based measurements of welfare (locomotion, hock lesions, body condition score, hygiene, respiration rates, mortality, and mastitis prevalence) were collected on each farm. Lameness prevalence (proportion of cows with locomotion score 3 on a 1 to 5 scale, where 1=normal and 5=severely lame) in CB barns (4.4%) was lower than that in NV (15.9%) and CV (13.1%) barns. Lameness prevalence was similar between CV and NV barns. Hock lesion prevalence (proportion of cows with a lesion score 2 on a 1 to 3 scale, where 1=normal, 2=hair loss, and 3=swelling) was lower in CB barns (3.8%) than in CV (31.2%) and NV barns (23.9%). Hygiene scores (1 to 5 scale, where 1=clean and 5=very dirty) were higher for CB (3.18) than CV (2.83) and NV (2.77) barns, with no differences between CV and NV barns. Body condition scores, respiration rates, mastitis prevalence, culling, and mortality rates did not differ among housing systems. The CV and NV barns were evaluated using the cow comfort index (proportion of cows lying down in a stall divided by all animals touching a stall) and the stall usage index (proportion of cows lying divided by all animals in the pen not eating). The CV barns tended to have greater cow comfort index (85.9%) than the NV barns (81.4%) and had greater stall usage index (76.8% and 71.5%, respectively). Dairy cattle housed in CB barns had reduced lameness and hock lesions compared with those housed in freestall barns and had no adverse associations with body condition, respiration rates, mastitis prevalence, culling, or mortality. When comparing the 2 freestall housing options, CV barns had improved cow comfort indices compared with NV barns. Although cows in CB barns had better feet and leg health, as indicated by the reduced lameness and hock lesion prevalence, acquiring bedding and managing the bedded pack could limit their use.	94	11	5469-5479	English	Sub National	2		United States of America	Minnesota|South Dakota	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The objective of this cohort study was to investigate animal welfare in 2 newer dairy housing options in the upper Midwest, cross-ventilated freestall barns (CV) and compost-bedded-pack barns (CB), compared with conventional, naturally ventilated freestall barns (NV).	0.92	January-Nov 2008	18	18	NR	Holstein;Holstein cross	N	Clinical lameness;Lameness (Unspecified)	%;Body Condition Score	8

Assessment of welfare indicators in dairy farms offering pasture at differing levels	Animal	doi:10.1017/S1751731119000570			In terms of animal welfare, farming systems of dairy cows are perceived positively by consumers when compared to pigs or poultry. A main reason is that the majority of consumers associate dairy farming with pasture, which in turn they relate with benefits for animal health and welfare. However, holistic scientific assessments of the effects of pasturing on animal welfare are rare. Hence, it was the aim to study the animal welfare level in 61 German loose housing dairy farms by using the measures of the Welfare QualityR protocol for dairy cattle (WQP). Data were collected twice per farm at the end of the pasture season (July to October) and approximately 6 months later at the end of the barn season (December to April). Farms were classified based on the duration cows had access to pasture per day during the pasture season: group 1 (G1)>10 h; group 2 (G2) 6 to 10 h; group 3 (G3)<6 h and group 4 (G4) without pasture access. The average herd size was 129 Holstein-Friesian or Red-Holstein cows (range 58 to 527). In addition to WQP data, performance data were gathered from routine herd data recordings. The indicators were aggregated to criteria applying the scoring system of the WQP. G4 received lower scores at the first than at the second visit for the criterion absence of hunger, while there were no differences between visits in the other groups (P=0.58 - group x farm visit effect). All pasturing groups were scored better at the end of the pasture season than G4 for the criterion comfort around resting (P<0.01). Compared with G1 for both farm visits and G2 for the end of the barn season, G4 reached inferior scores for the criterion absence of injuries, including indicators such as hairless patches, lesions, and swellings and lameness. At both assessments G2 was scored higher than the other groups for the criterion absence of diseases (P=0.04). In conclusion, pasture access had positive effects only on selected welfare indicators, however, these effects were not maintained throughout the barn season.	13	10	2336-2347	English	Sub National	61		Germany	Lower Saxony	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	it was the aim of the study to assess the welfare level applying the measures of the WQP in zero-grazing dairy farms and farms providing pasture access at differing levels.	0.83	Jul 2014-Apr 2015	61	61	8011	Holstein Cross	N	Mastitis;Lameness (Unspecified);Severe Lameness;Dirty Legs/Flanks/Udders;Avoidance Distance;Human–animal–relationship (Unspecified);Emotional State (Unspecified);Social Behaviour (Unspecified);Aggression;Body condition;Absence of hunger;Vaginal discharge;Dystocia;Coughs;Nasal discharge;Hampered respiration;Mortality;Hairless Patches;Diarrhoea;Ocular discharge	Welfare Quality® protocol 	8

Farms were classified based on the duration cows had access to pasture per day during the pasture season: group 1 (G1)>10 h; group 2 (G2) 6 to 10 h; group 3 (G3)<6 h and group 4 (G4) without pasture access. The average herd size was 129 Holstein-Friesian or Red-Holstein cows (range 58 to 527). In addition to WQP data, performance data were gathered from routine herd data recordings. The indicators were aggregated to criteria applying the scoring system of the WQP. G4 received lower scores at the first than at the second visit for the criterion absence of hunger, while there were no differences between visits in the other groups (P=0.58 - group x farm visit effect). All pasturing groups were scored better at the end of the pasture season than G4 for the criterion comfort around resting (P<0.01). Compared with G1 for both farm visits and G2 for the end of the barn season, G4 reached inferior scores for the criterion absence of injuries, including indicators such as hairless patches, lesions, and swellings and lameness. At both assessments G2 was scored higher than the other groups for the criterion absence of diseases (P=0.04). In conclusion, pasture access had positive effects only on selected welfare indicators, however, these effects were not maintained throughout the barn season.	13	10	2336-2347	English	Sub National	61		Germany	Lower Saxony	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	it was the aim of the study to assess the welfare level applying the measures of the WQP in zero-grazing dairy farms and farms providing pasture access at differing levels.	0.83	Jul 2014-Apr 2015	61	61	8011	Holstein Cross	N	Mastitis;Lameness (Unspecified);Severe Lameness;Dirty Legs/Flanks/Udders;Avoidance Distance;Human–animal–relationship (Unspecified);Emotional State (Unspecified);Social Behaviour (Unspecified);Aggression;Body condition;Absence of hunger;Vaginal discharge;Dystocia;Coughs;Nasal discharge;Hampered respiration;Mortality;Hairless Patches;Diarrhoea;Ocular discharge	Welfare Quality® protocol 	8

Assessment of welfare indicators in dairy farms offering pasture at differing levels	Animal	doi:10.1017/S1751731119000570			In terms of animal welfare, farming systems of dairy cows are perceived positively by consumers when compared to pigs or poultry. A main reason is that the majority of consumers associate dairy farming with pasture, which in turn they relate with benefits for animal health and welfare. However, holistic scientific assessments of the effects of pasturing on animal welfare are rare. Hence, it was the aim to study the animal welfare level in 61 German loose housing dairy farms by using the measures of the Welfare QualityR protocol for dairy cattle (WQP). Data were collected twice per farm at the end of the pasture season (July to October) and approximately 6 months later at the end of the barn season (December to April).

Codes of practice provide dairy producers with best practice guidance for the care and handling of their cattle. New Canadian recommendations have been established for the dairy industry. The objectives of this study were to develop an on-farm assessment tool that helps producers assess how well they are meeting their code of practice and that identifies management and environment modifications that could improve dairy cow comfort on their farms. The assessment tool addressed critical areas of dairy cow comfort, including accommodation and housing (stall design, space allowance, stall management, pen management, milking parlor, and transfer alleys), feed and water (body condition scoring, nutrition), and health and welfare (lameness, claw health, and hoof-trimming). Targets of good practices were identified from the requirements and recommendations of the code of practice. Each farm received a score for each target, ranging from 0 (target not reached) to 100 (target reached). One hundred tiestall and 110 freestall farms were surveyed in 3 provinces of Canada (Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta). The duration of the assessment, in 2 visits lasting, on average, 8 and 9. h (range between freestall and tiestall farms) and 4 and 4.1. h, was beyond the targeted 3 to 4. h due mainly to the animal-based measures; strategies to reduce the duration of the assessment were discussed. Standard operating procedures were developed to ensure consistency in measuring and recording data. Periodical checks were conducted by trainers to ensure all 15 assessors remained above target agreement of weighted kappa 0.6. Average scores for all critical areas ranged from 25 to 89% for freestall farms and from 48 to 95% for tiestall farms. These scores need to be considered with caution when comparing farms because scores could not always be calculated the same way between housing systems. An evaluation report was provided and discussed with each producer, identifying strengths and areas for improvement that could benefit dairy cow comfort on their farms. The producers were convinced of the effectiveness of our tool for assessing cow comfort (freestall: 86%; tiestall: 95%) and in assisting them to make decisions for improvements (freestall: 83%; tiestall: 93%). Our cow comfort assessment tool served as background material for the Dairy Farmers of Canada animal care assessment program.	98	1	698-708	English	Sub National	210		Canada	Quebec|Alberta|Ontario	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	As a natural extension of the DFC Code of Practice implementation, the objective of this research project was to develop an on-farm animal comfort assessment tool that helps producers assess how well they are meeting the Code (DFC-NFACC, 2009) and that identifies management and environment modifications that could improve dairy cow comfort on their farms. In our assessment of the tool, we considered both the feasibility of using it on farms and the likelihood that it would be implemented by field advisors and producers. Five goals were established that would need to be met if the tool were to be implemented successfully. The time required to complete an animal welfare assessment is a critical factor in its success (Sørensen et al., 2007). Our first goal was to ensure that the evaluation could be completed within an acceptable time limit. The second goal was that data should be collected in the same way by multiple, independent assessors, to ensure a highly repeatable assessment. The third goal was to check that the targets set for the farm evaluation are realistic in terms of their ability to discriminate between herds and at the same time, ensure that areas of improvement are detectable. Finally, the fourth goal was to ensure that the dairy producers, who are the end users of the assessment tool, would consider this tool useful in encouraging improvements in dairy cattle comfort.	2	2010-2012	210	210	24200	Holstein	N	Claw health/Hoof trimming (study specific tool);Hock Injuries;Lameness (Unspecified);Lying time;Body condition	%;Body Condition Score	5

The study included 34 dairy operations with herd sizes ranging from 130 to 3,700 lactating cows. Forty-five percent of the herds had mattresses and 55% had deep-bedded stalls. Farms were visited once between July and October 2009. At the time of visit, at least 50% of the cows in each lactating pen were scored for locomotion, hygiene, and hock lesions. On-farm herd records were collected for the entire year and used to investigate mortality, culling, milk production, and mastitis incidence. Stall surface was associated with lameness and hock lesion prevalence. Lameness prevalence (locomotion score ≥ 3 on a 1 to 5 scale) was lower in deep-bedded freestalls (14.4%) than freestalls with mattresses (19.8%). Severe lameness prevalence (locomotion score ≥ 4) was also lower for cows housed in deep-bedded freestalls (3.6%) than for cows housed in freestalls with mattresses (5.9%). In addition, the prevalence of hock lesions (hock lesion scores ≥ 2 on a 1 to 3 scale, with 1=no lesion, 2=hair loss or mild lesion, and 3=swelling or severe lesion) and severe hock lesions (hock lesion score=3) was lower in herds with deep-bedded freestalls (49.4%; 6.4%) than in herds with mattresses (67.3%; 13.2%). Herd turnover rates were not associated with stall surface; however, the percentage of removals due to voluntary (low milk production, disposition, and dairy) and involuntary (death, illness, injury, and reproductive) reasons was different between deep-bedded and mattress-based freestalls. Voluntary removals averaged 16% of all herd removals in deep-bedded herds, whereas in mattress herds, these removals were 8%.

Farms were visited once between July and October 2009. At the time of visit, at least 50% of the cows in each lactating pen were scored for locomotion, hygiene, and hock lesions. On-farm herd records were collected for the entire year and used to investigate mortality, culling, milk production, and mastitis incidence. Stall surface was associated with lameness and hock lesion prevalence. Lameness prevalence (locomotion score ≥ 3 on a 1 to 5 scale) was lower in deep-bedded freestalls (14.4%) than freestalls with mattresses (19.8%). Severe lameness prevalence (locomotion score ≥ 4) was also lower for cows housed in deep-bedded freestalls (3.6%) than for cows housed in freestalls with mattresses (5.9%). In addition, the prevalence of hock lesions (hock lesion scores ≥ 2 on a 1 to 3 scale, with 1=no lesion, 2=hair loss or mild lesion, and 3=swelling or severe lesion) and severe hock lesions (hock lesion score=3) was lower in herds with deep-bedded freestalls (49.4%; 6.4%) than in herds with mattresses (67.3%; 13.2%). Herd turnover rates were not associated with stall surface; however, the percentage of removals due to voluntary (low milk production, disposition, and dairy) and involuntary (death, illness, injury, and reproductive) reasons was different between deep-bedded and mattress-based freestalls. Voluntary removals averaged 16% of all herd removals in deep-bedded herds, whereas in mattress herds, these removals were 8%. Other welfare measurements such as cow hygiene, mortality rate, mastitis incidence, and milk production were not associated with stall surface.	95	10	5626-5634	English	Sub National	34		United States of America	Upper Midwest US	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	the objective of this study was to investigate the association between stall surface and some animal welfare measurements (locomotion, hock lesions, hygiene, mortality, herd turnover rates, milk production, and clinical mastitis incidence) in herds using RMS as bedding for dairy cows.	6 months	Jul 2009-Jan 2010	34	NR	103-3673	Holstein;Jersey	N	SCC/SCS	#;SCS	7

Behavioral observations were made for 3 consecutive days in 3 periods after transition. The cows (n=105) were observed on 18 sampling occasions for 1 month. Recordings were made of body positions and general and social behaviors. Monthly milk records were collected 1 year before and 1 year after transition. Cows walked more during the 1st observation period than during the other periods (p<.05). Walking activity also differed between days when nested to period (p<.05). During the 1st period, cows ruminated while standing more than during the 3rd period (p<.05). Cows ate and groomed less and vocalized more during the 1st period (p<.05). It was concluded that after transition from a tied to a cubicle system, several behaviors were affected during the 1st days, and milk production of multiparous cows was negatively affected, although this effect was not long-term.	21	1	82-92	English	Sub National	11		Estonia	Central Estonia	Empirical	Quantitative	BA	The aim of this case study was to investigate if and for how long behavior and milk production changed when dairy cows were moved from tied housing to cubicle housing.	2	Jan 2005-Dec 2006	11	11	960	Holstein cross	N	SCC/SCS	#;SCS	7

They were matched for having the same cow numbers, flooring type and similar milk yield. The prevalence of lameness, claw lesions and their severity grades were analysed. Two claw health indicators, the cow claw score (CCS) and the farm claw score (FCS), were calculated using a computerised claw trimming database programme; there was no significant difference in overall lameness prevalence in cows from five compost bedded barns (18.7%) compared to cows from five freestall cubicle herds (14.9%). A cumulative link mixed model (CLMM) did not show significant differences in locomotion between different types of bedding material, flooring system, breed, visit number, observer and time since last trimming, but locomotion was significantly influenced by CCS. Another CLMM tested the impact of parameters mentioned on CCS and showed significant influence of flooring type, visit number and cattle breed. Statistically significant differences in the prevalence of claw disorders between compost bedded and freestall cubicle barns were found for white line disease (WLD; 20.4% and 46.6%, respectively), heel horn erosion (HHE; 26.9% and 59.9%, respectively), concave dorsal wall as a result of chronic laminitis (6.5% and 15.9%, respectively) and for interdigital hyperplasia (0.2% and 3.1%, respectively). The results of this study indicate that compost dairy barns are a good alternative to common cubicle housing systems in terms of lameness, claw health and animal welfare.	216		81-86	English	National	16		Austria		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of lameness and the prevalence and type of claw lesions in cows kept in compost dairy barns (CBB) and to compare these results with the data from cows kept in conventional loose housing systems with freestall cubicles (FCB), hypothesising that CBB are associated with lower prevalences of lameness and claw lesions.	1.33	Mar 2014-Jul 2015	16	16	NR	Fleckvieh;Holstein cross	N	SCC/SCS	#;SCS	8

For each of the 4 housing systems, 5 farms with a herd size of 70 to 200 lactating cows in Lower Saxony, Germany, were studied. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded hourly in each barn to calculate THI. Milk production data included 21,546 test-day records for milk, fat, and protein yield, and SCS. These data were associated with the average THI of the 3 d preceding the respective measurement, which was divided into 6 classes (<45, >=45 to <50, >=50 to <55, >=55 to <60, >=60 to <65, and >=65). Furthermore, bulk milk samples including the fat and protein percentage, and SCS taken 4 to 6 times per month were associated with the average and maximum THI of the 3 d before sampling. Data were recorded from April 2010 to March 2011. In each of the housing systems, monthly THI values above 60, indicating heat stress, were recorded between June and September, with higher values in WI and WG. In all systems, fat-corrected milk, fat, and protein yields of the test-day records decreased in tendency from 60 <= THI<65 to THI >65. In WI and CI, values for SCS were greater in the class THI > 65 than in 60 <= THI<65, whereas no difference between any of the THI classes was found in WG and CG. The fat and protein percentage of the bulk milk samples decreased with increasing 3-d maximum THI in all 4 systems, whereas the SCS increased with increasing 3-d average THI. In conclusion, negative effects of heat stress conditions under a temperate climate on milk production traits and SCS were found, although a housing system being superior to the other systems in altering heat stress effects was not identified.

Sound state of health and welfare of dairy cows remain the essential conditions for the quality of milk and dairy products, as well as important public health aspects. This paper presents the currently applicable welfare standards for farm animals, the European priority activities in the field of welfare of farm animals, and the results of inquiry into the state of play in dairy cow housing systems in the narrower northeastern territory of Slovenia. Ten free housing system dairy farms and ten tether system dairy farms were inspected, compared and assessed according to the Austrian method of the Animal Needs Index (ANI) for cattle. ANI is a relevant criterion for assessing the adequacy of husbandry systems, based on graded point system. The five areas of influence impacting animal welfare were assessed, including: affording movement ('Locomotion'), affording social interaction ('Social interaction'), type and condition of flooring ('Flooring'), light and air conditions ('Light and Air'), including ventilation and noise level, and quality of care for the animals ('Stockmanship'). Adequacy of housing conditions was evaluated and compared between the free housing and tether systems for dairy cows. The paper further presents the state of health of animals examined and the scope of diseases detected, including technopathies and injuries, reasons for culling dairy cows and herd structure by the end of 2009, in either of the two husbandry systems.

Comparison of welfare of dairy cows under tether and free housing conditions	Krmiva				Milk production on Slovenian farms is an important economic activity that underwent essential changes after the introduction of the European Union standards. Sound state of health and welfare of dairy cows remain the essential conditions for the quality of milk and dairy products, as well as important public health aspects. This paper presents the currently applicable welfare standards for farm animals, the European priority activities in the field of welfare of farm animals, and the results of inquiry into the state of play in dairy cow housing systems in the narrower northeastern territory of Slovenia. Ten free housing system dairy farms and ten tether system dairy farms were inspected, compared and assessed according to the Austrian method of the Animal Needs Index (ANI) for cattle. ANI is a relevant criterion for assessing the adequacy of husbandry systems, based on graded point system. The five areas of influence impacting animal welfare were assessed, including: affording movement ('Locomotion'), affording social interaction ('Social interaction'), type and condition of flooring ('Flooring'), light and air conditions ('Light and Air'), including ventilation and noise level, and quality of care for the animals ('Stockmanship'). Adequacy of housing conditions was evaluated and compared between the free housing and tether systems for dairy cows. The paper further presents the state of health of animals examined and the scope of diseases detected, including technopathies and injuries, reasons for culling dairy cows and herd structure by the end of 2009, in either of the two husbandry systems.

The five areas of influence impacting animal welfare were assessed, including: affording movement ('Locomotion'), affording social interaction ('Social interaction'), type and condition of flooring ('Flooring'), light and air conditions ('Light and Air'), including ventilation and noise level, and quality of care for the animals ('Stockmanship'). Adequacy of housing conditions was evaluated and compared between the free housing and tether systems for dairy cows. The paper further presents the state of health of animals examined and the scope of diseases detected, including technopathies and injuries, reasons for culling dairy cows and herd structure by the end of 2009, in either of the two husbandry systems. The advantages and disadvantages of the method used for assessing the adequacy of each husbandry system are presented as well.	52	6	317-331	English	Sub National	20		Slovenia	North-Eastern Slovenia	Empirical	Quantitative	CI	This paper presents the currently applicable welfare standards for farm animals, the European priority activities in the field of welfare of farm animals, and the results of inquiry into the state of play in dairy cow housing systems in the narrower north- eastern territory of Slovenia.

Average crude protein, casein and urea content in milk varied significantly among farms. NPN content in cow milk varies among farms - from 0.194% to 0.232%. Average crude protein and casein content was significantly higher (p<0.05) for Latvia Brown breed cows, while NPN content did not differ significantly among breeds. Regression between NPN and urea content in milk was R² = 0.458. Correlation between NPN and urea content was significant (r = 0.677). This study allowed establishing that crude protein and NPN content in milk varied significantly (p<0.05) in farms with differing dairy cow housing and feeding technologies	32	1	36-40	English	National	4		Latvia		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	Research aims at finding out content of cure protein and non-nitrogen protein in cow milk.	0.083	41153	4	4	30	Latvian Brown;Other crossbreds	N	Mastitis	%	8

Structural changes lead to increasing sizes of dairy herds and a reduction in grazing use. Thus, cows spend more time in the barn and become more exposed to the barn environment. The cubicle surface can result in damages of the cows' hock joint integument. Pasture is generally seen as a beneficial environment for cows. We hypothesized that a higher number of daily grazing hours reduce the probability of hock joint alterations in dairy cows from large herds. In total, 3148 lactating cows from 36 grazing and 20 zero-grazing dairy herds, with an average herd size of 173 cows, were assessed individually on one randomly selected body side for alterations in hock integument (score 0 for no alterations or hairless areas <2 cm, 1 for at least one hairless area of 2 cm, 2 for lesion or swelling). The cows were further assessed for lameness and cleanliness. Information on breed, parity and days in milk per cow was extracted from a national database. Cubicle surface was evaluated for each herd. Daily grazing hours 30 days before herd visits were recorded by the stockmen and later categorized as follows: zero hours (zero-grazing), few hours (3 to 9) and many hours (>9 to 21). The effects of daily grazing hours and other potential cow and herd-level risk factors were evaluated for their impact on hock integument alterations using a logistic analysis with a multi-level model structure. The probability for hock integument alterations such as hair loss, lesions or swellings decreased with increasing amount of grazing hours (odds of 3 to 9 h 2.2 times and odds of >9 to 21 h 4.8 times lower than of zero-grazing). The probability for only lesions or swellings decreased with >9 to 21 grazing hours (odds 2.1 times) but not with 3 to 9 h (odds 1.0 times) compared with zero-grazing. Lameness, hard cubicle surface and Danish Holstein v. other breeds showed an increasing effect on the probability for integument alterations. Increase in days in milk only showed an increasing effect on the probability for lesions and swellings. We concluded that a long daily stay on pasture is most beneficial for the hock joint integument of a dairy cow.

Clinical mastitis in Macedonian dairy herds	Acta Veterinaria	10.2298/AVB1301063T		http://www.vet.bg.ac.rs/~acta/	The purpose of this study is the determination of the occurrence and prevalence of clinical mastitis and lactation incidence risk on three dairy farms. A one year study on a total of 1031 black-white breed cows with a total of 1267 lactations was performed. Each dairy farm implemented a different technology of rearing and was of different herd size (farm A - tie-stalls, 162 cows; farm B - loose-housing system with open shed and deep bedding, 357 dairy cows; and farm C - loosehousing system with enclosed shed, 512 cows). Clinical mastitis in cows was detected by clinical examination of the udder and determination of abnormalities in the milk. To distinguish two consecutive cases of clinical mastitis within the same lactation a time period of nine days was used. Annual prevalence rate of clinical mastitis for the entire population of cows was 34.13% on cow level, and 30.07% on lactation level. There was a high prevalence rate of clinical mastitis in primiparous cows, 21.43%, 40.77% and 12.55%, on farms A, B and C, respectively. Lactation incident risk for cows on farm A was 25.00%, farm B 95.58% and farm C 21.49%. The prevalence of clinical mastitis and lactation incidence risk tended to increase with increasing parity. The annual lactation risk for the entire population of cows was 45.86%. All indicators for the determination of the occurrence of clinical mastitis in dairy farms, which were observed during the research, showed the greatest values on farm B. Most of the cows manifested one (68.24%) or two (18.63%) cases of clinical mastitis during lactation. There was a long period in lactation until the appearance of the first case of clinical mastitis (112.21 ± 92.04 days). Generally, clinical mastitis was registered during the whole period of the survey, with some fluctuations between different seasons. The method of GLM (General Linear Model), univariate procedure, was used to analyze associations between the incidence of clinical mastitis and farm management, parity of cows and season of the year. Pearson's coefficient of correlation was performed for analysis of interdependence on variables in the model. There was statistical significance (p<0,001) between the season and incidence of clinical mastitis.	63	1	63-76	English	National	3		North Macedonia		Empirical	Quantitative	CI	The purpose of this study is the determination of the occurrence and prevalence of clinical mastitis and lactation incidence risk on three dairy farms.	1	Feb 2009-Jan 2010	3	3	1031	Holstein cross	N			7
