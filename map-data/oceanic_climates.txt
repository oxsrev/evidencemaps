Effects of length of ley in the rotation were detected in soil organic carbon, yield of wheat and yield of potatoes 6, 6 and 7 years, resp., after the last ley was ploughed up. The effect of grazing the leys compared with mowing was detected in soil organic carbon and in yield of potatoes, and that of applying dung was detected in soil organic carbon and in yield of potatoes 12 and 13 years, resp., after the last application."

O'Leary	2019	Effects of long-term rotation and tillage practice on grain yield and protein of wheat and soil fertility on a vertosol in a medium-rainfall temperate environment	"Fundamental changes in farming systems occurred throughout the medium-rainfall zone of southern Australia during the late 1990s. Pulse and canola crops replaced pastures and long-fallowing, and minimal-tillage practices were increasingly adopted. An experiment was established in 1998 to examine long-term effects of these changes on crop productivity and soil fertility. Nine rotation-tillage treatments based on 3- and 6-year cycles were compared by using wheat (Triticum aestivum) as a bioassay crop over 2001-17. Seasonal conditions during the study ranged from the Millennium Drought to the top rainfall decile. Averaged across the 17 seasons, wheat yields were significantly lower in rotations based on continuous wheat (1.73t/ha) or 3 years of perennial Lucerne (Medicago sativa) (1.93t/ha) and highest after traditional long-fallow (2.92t/ha) or vetch (Vicia sativa) green manure (2.57t/ha). Wheat yields following a pulse (2.23t/ha) or canola (Brassica napus) (2.21t/ha) were intermediate. Whereas rotation effects varied with seasonal rainfall, there was a long-term trend for relative yields in continuous wheat rotations to decline and those following a green manure or fallow to differ increasingly from other treatments. Compared across the Same rotation (canola-wheat-pulse), average wheat yields under no-tillage (2.09t/ha) were significant lower (P<0.05) than under reduced (2.22t/ha) and conventional (2.29t/ha) tillage. By contrast, grain protein concentration increased with increasing proportion and type of legumes (green manure and pasture > pulse) in the rotation via their effect on soil mineral nitrogen (N). Lowest protein was recorded in continuous wheat and highest where at least one-third of the rotation contained a non-pulse legume, i.e. vetch green manure, Lucerne or annual medic (Medicago truncatula). Soil-borne cereal fungal pathogens and nematodes generally had little effect on grain yields. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N stocks declined in all treatments over time, except in the Lucerne and green manure treatments, where total N was maintained. Greatest declines in SOC and total N occurred in the fallow treatment. Results from the first 20 years of experimentation suggest that differences in grain yield (and protein) of wheat were most likely the result of treatment (rotation and tillage practice) effects on soil nitrate and water (growing-season rainfall and fallow storage) rather than disease. We found no evidence that current farming systems based on use of pulses, canola and reduced tillage are less able to maintain intervening cereal yields than traditional systems. On the contrary, practices such as long-fallowing are expected to have increasing negative influence on productivity in the longer term via decreased soil C and N fertility."

Cohan	2014	Long-term effect of contrasted tillage and crop management on soil carbon dynamics during 41 years	"Although numerous studies have been conducted on the effect of tillage on soil organic carbon (SOC), there is still no consensus on the importance of sequestration which can be expected from reduced tillage. Most studies have used a synchronic approach in fields or long-term experiments which were often poorly characterized with respect to initial conditions. In this paper, we used a diachronic approach to quantify SOC changes in a 41 years experiment comparing no-till (NT), shallow till (ST) and full inversion tillage (FIT) combined with crop managements (residues removal, rotation and catch crops). It included SOC measurements at time 0 and every 4 years, calculations at equivalent soil mass within or below the old ploughed layer. Results show that tillage or crop management had no significant effect on SOC stocks after 41 years both in the old ploughed layer (ca. 0-28 cm) and deeper (ca. 0-58 cm). Tillage had no effect on crop yields and residues. In the reduced tillage treatments (ST and NT), SOC accumulated in the surface layer (0-10 cm), reaching a plateau after 24 years but declined continuously in the lower layer (10-28 cm) at a rate of 0.42-0.44% yr(-1). The difference in SOC stocks (ST or NT minus FIT) over the old ploughed layer followed a non-monotonic pattern over time. Reduced tillage caused a rapid SOC sequestration during the first 4 years which remained more or less constant (mean = 2.17 and 1.31 t ha(-1), resp.) during the next 24 years and disappeared after 28 years. The drop was attributed to the higher water balance recorded during years 24-28. In the reduced tillage treatments, the changes in SOC over time were negatively correlated with the water balance, indicating that sequestration rate was positive in dry periods and negative in wet conditions. This study highlights the interest of diachronic approaches to understand the effect of tillage and its interaction with environmental and management factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of such comparisons may depend considerably on the design of the respective systems and climate and soil conditions under which they are performed. Here, we compare a range of arable organic and conventional crop systems at three sites (Jyndevad, Foulum and Flakkebjerg) in Denmark through long-term experiments initiated in 1997. The experimental treatments in the organic farming systems included use of whole-year green manure crops, catch crops and animal manure (as cattle, pig or digested slurry). Data on plant residues and animal manure were used to estimate C inputs to the soil. This was compared with measured changes in topsoil (0-25 cm) SOC content over 4-8 years. During 1997-2004, green manure, catch crops and animal manure enhanced estimated C input by 0.9, 1.0 and 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively, across all locations. Based on measured SOC changes, green manure enhanced SOC by 0.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and catch crops by 0.2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), while animal manure by insignificantly 0.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). After 2005, advantages of using green manure (grass-clover) on SOC change disappeared, because cuttings of the grass-clover was removed whereas before 2005 they were mulched in the field, albeit there was still a small extra estimated C input of 0.2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). An estimated higher C input of 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) with catch crops did not result in significant increase in measured topsoil SOC. From 2005-2008, the first 4 years of comparison between organic and conventional farming at all three sites, organic farming with animal manure had 0.3 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) higher estimated C input, but SOC measurements showed that conventional farming accumulated 0.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) more SOC than organic farming. At Foulum from 2005 to 2012, organic farming with animal manure had 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) more input, and topsoil SOC measurements showed a higher accumulation of 0.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in organic compared with conventional fanning. Regressions of changes in topsoil SOC against estimated C inputs showed that 10-20% of C inputs were retained in topsoil SOC over the experimental period. There was no clear indication that belowground C input contributed more to SOC than aboveground C inputs. Despite consistently higher estimated C inputs in organic versus conventional systems, we were not able to detect consistent differences in measured SOC between the systems."

Yeoman	1994	"Effects of one to six year old ryegrass-clover leys on soil nitrogen and on the subsequent yields and fertilizer nitrogen requirements of the arable sequence winter wheat, potatoes, winter wheat, winter beans (Vicia faba) grown on a sandy loam soil"	"In a trial at Woburn, England established in 1980, the largest yields of wheat and potatoes came from the combination of longer Lolium perenne-Trifolium repens ley (at least 3 years) + optimum fertilizer N but yields of V. faba were decreased where N had been given to the previous crops. Without fertilizer N, 2-year-old leys significantly increased yields compared with 1-year leys and the effect of longer leys was small except for the 1st wheat, when grain yields were large and plateaued after the 3-year ley. Exponential response curves were fitted to the wheat yields and an exponential + linear trend to the potato yields after each of the leys to estimate maximum total and economic yields and and their associated N dressings. Maximum economic yields of wheat in 1987 ranged from 8.11 to 9.14 t grain/ha and the fertilizer N required declined from 174 kg/ha after the 1-year ley to 48 kg/ha after the 6-year ley. For potatoes in 1988, yields ranged from 63 to 71 t tubers/ha but the N required (137-150 kg/ha) varied little with ley age. For winter wheat in 1989, yields ranged from 5.51 to 6.99 t grain/ha, because of drought but, as with the potatoes, the N required (203-218 kg/ha) varied little. For each crop the 6 individual N response curves could be shifted to bring them into coincidence, and the benefits of the ley estimated in terms of a quantity of fertilizer N applied in spring (horizontal shift) and effects other than spring N (vertical shift). The spring N effects relative to the 1-year ley varied with ley age; for the 1st wheat the range was from 6 to 126 kg N/ha for the 2- to 6-year leys, respectively. Spring N effects were negligible, however, for potatoes (average 6 kg/ha) and also for wheat in the 3rd year (6 kg/ha). Benefits other than those which could be ascribed to spring N increased yield of the 1st wheat, on average, by 0.94 t grain/ha for the 2- to 5-year leys; for potatoes they ranged from 3.5 to 8.1 t tubers/ha for the 3- to 6-year leys; for the 3rd crop wheat they ranged from 0.86 to 1.49 t grain/ha for the 3- to 6-year leys. On average, the 1st wheat recovered only 34% of the applied fertilizer N whilst potatoes and the following wheat recovered 55 and 56%, respectively. Longer leys increased the N fertilizer use efficiency. Increasing ley age up to 5 years increased total soil C by a maximum of 0.17% C; 18% of the C content of the soil in the 1-year ley plots. This small increase in soil OM provided up to 230 kg mineral N/ha in the 1st autumn after ploughing. Between 17 Oct. 1986 and 27 Apr. 1987 the average loss of NO<sub>3</sub>-N from soils following 3- to 6-year leys was equivalent to 202 kg N/ha, whilst the average uptake of N by 11 May in the aboveground wheat was only 88 kg/ha; the net loss was 114 kg N/ha. A computer simulation, which included mineralization of organic N during this period together with N uptake and nitrate leaching losses, computed a loss of 250 kg N/ha following the 6-year ley, which would have given 400 mg NO<sub>3</sub>/litre in the 275 mm through drainage that winter."

White	2017	Changes in soil organic matter over 70 years in continuous arable and ley-arable rotations on a sandy loam soil in England	"The sequestration in soil of organic carbon (SOC) derived from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by replacing arable crops with leys, has been measured over 70 years on a sandy loam soil. The experiment was designed initially to test the effect of leys on the yields of arable crops. A 3-year grazed grass with clover (grass + clover) ley in a 5-year rotation with arable crops increased percentage organic carbon (%OC) in the top 25 cm of the soil from 0.98 to 1.23 in 28 years, but with little further increase during the next 40 years with all-grass leys given fertilizer nitrogen (N). In this second period, OC inputs were balanced by losses, suggesting that about 1.3% OC might be near the equilibrium content for this rotation. Including 3-year lucerne (Medicago sativa) leys had little effect on%OC over 28 years, but after changing to grass + clover leys,%OC increased to 1.24 during the next 40 years. Eight-year leys (all grass with N or grass + clover) in 10-year rotations with arable crops were started in the 1970s, and after three rotations%OC had increased to ca. 1.40 in 2000-2009. Over 70 years,%OC declined from 0.98 to 0.94 in an all-arable rotation with mainly cereals and to 0.82 with more root crops. Applications of 38 t ha<sup>-1</sup> farmyard manure (FYM) every fifth year increased%OC by 0.13% by the mid-1960s when applications ceased. Soil treated with FYM still contained 0.10% more OC in 2000-2009. Changes in the amount of OC have been modelled with RothC-26.3 and estimated inputs of C for selected rotations. Little of the OC input during the 70 years has been retained; most was retained in the grazed ley rotation, but 9 t ha<sup>-1</sup> only of a total input of 189 t ha<sup>-1</sup>. In other rotations more than 98% of the total OC input was lost. Despite large losses of C, annual increases in OC of 4 per mil are possible on this soil type with the inclusion of grass or grass + clover leys or the application of FYM, but only for a limited period. Such increases in SOC might help to limit increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Highlights: Can leys sequester significant amounts of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in SOM and contribute to the 4 per mil initiative Changes in the percentage and amount of OC were measured and modelled over 70 years and OC losses estimated. Three-year grass or grass + clover leys increased%OC, but only to an equilibrium level that was then maintained. Despite large losses, sequestering CO<sub>2</sub>-C at 4 per mil year<sup>-1</sup> by growing grass or grass + clover leys is possible."

Haesaert	2019	Does shifting from conventional to zero tillage in combination with a cover crop offers opportunities for silage maize cultivation in Flanders?	"Tillage is an important agricultural practice, influencing the physical, chemical and biological soil characteristics. In this paper the influence of various tillage systems combined with or without a cover crop under different nitrogen fertilization levels on silage maize yield and soil fertility was investigated. Based on a field trial in Bottelare (Belgium), during the period 2007-2015, it was concluded that for each tillage system higher nitrogen levels resulted in a higher yield. In addition, the highest yield was achieved for the conventional tillage system, the yield gain for mouldboard ploughing varied between 13% (2015) and 71% (2012) compared to zero tillage. In case reduced tillage was adopted, the yield loss compared to mouldboard ploughing varied between 6% (2013 and 2015) and 24% (2012). Furthermore, it seemed that the accumulated temperature during the growing season and rainfall around flowering were decisive in determining maize yield. Additionally, rainfall in the period 60 days post sowing was significantly negatively correlated with the yield from the zero tillage plots, whereas in case tillage was adopted no correlations with rainfall 60 days post sowing were detected. Concerning the soil organic carbon content and the amount of earthworms, no clear trends could be observed. Zero tillage resulted in high weed pressure and caused soil compaction. So, in this trial, under humid conditions, the less labor intensive zero tillage system did not result in competitive maize yields. In conclusion, reduced tillage methods offer opportunities for maize cultivation in Belgium.

Therefore, adopting a reduced tillage system can be seen as a valid alternative for ploughing as this tillage system ensures a sustainable environment."

Justes	2016	Grain legume-based rotations managed under conventional tillage need cover crops to mitigate soil organic matter losses	"Inserting legumes in low-input innovative cropping systems can represent a good strategy to reduce current N fertilizer dependency while enhancing ecosystem services. However, although the impact of the use of legumes as cover crops has been broadly studied, very little is known about the effects of grain legume-based rotations on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SON). A cropping system experiment with three 3-year rotations with different levels of inclusion of grain legumes: GLO, GL1 and GL2 (none, one, and two grain legumes, respectively), with (CC) or without (BF, bare fallow) cover crops was established in SW France (Auzeville) under temperate climate. Durum wheat was present in all the rotations to act as an indicator of their performance. Soil organic C and SON were quantified before the beginning of the experiment and after 3 and 6 years (i.e., after one and two complete 3-yr rotations). Aboveground C and N inputs to the soil, and C and N harvest indexes and grain yield of the cash crops were also measured. Inserting grain legumes in the rotations significantly affected the amount of C and N inputs and consequently SOC and SON. After two cycles of the 3-yr rotation, the GL1 and GL2 treatments showed a greater decrease in SOC and SON when compared to GLO. However, the inclusion of cover crops in the rotations led to mitigate this loss. Durum wheat produced significantly greater grain yields in GU when compared to GLO, while GL2 presented intermediate values. In turn, the incorporation of cover crops did not reduce C and N harvest indexes or the grain yield of the different cash crops. We concluded that, in such conventionally-tilled grain legume-based rotations, the use of cover crops was efficient to mitigate SOC and SON losses and then increase N use efficiency at the cropping system level without reducing productivity.

The experiment area was located at Askov Experimental Station in Jutland, Denmark. The soil is a light sandy loam classified as an Alfisol (Typic Hapludalf). In spring 1996, the first plots were established with a grass mixture of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis), timothy (Phleum pratense) and smooth meadow grass (Poa pratensis) undersown in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare). Each year until 2001 new grass plots were established in the same way. Until grass ley establishment plots were maintained under spring barley. Plots under grass leys were subject to three to four cuttings in each production year (1997 to 2001). During this period, the leys received an annual dressing of mineral fertilizer (225 kg N, 48 kg P and 288 kg K/ha). Results indicated that in spite of lower NO<sub>3</sub>-N loss during the grass phase, well-balanced N inputs and C pool build-up no lasting residual effect could be observed after mixed-grass. The residual effect seemed to relate to stored and immediately released N, indicating that mixed-grass and inorganic fertilizers cannot increase longer-term soil fertility alone. Therefore, the present study stresses the importance of forage legumes, organic fertilizers and grazing animals in soil fertility build-up."	"DJF Rapport, Markbrug"	137		40-43		"B. T. Christensen, J.

The effects of different farm types (with and without livestock raising) combined with tillage treatments on plants, soil and environment have been investigated. This article presents results on soil fertility and cash crop yields according to the farm type especially in the 2nd and 3rd rotation. All in all, the superiority of a management system with cattle over stockless organic farming is demonstrated. The mixed farm type led to higher amounts of humus in the soil and to higher yields. Long term reduction of humus in stockless farming is not acceptable. Apart from organic matter recycling crop rotation in organic farming should have elements of SOM accumulating green manure crops such as perennial fodder legumes."

Soil receiving 4, 8 and 12tha21 of straw annually for 18 years contained 12, 21 and 30% more carbon (C), respectively, than soil with straw removal, and soil C and nitro- gen (N) contents increased linearly with straw rate. The soil retained 14% of the straw C and 37% of the straw N. Ryegrass catch-cropping for 10 years also increased soil C and N concentrations, whereas the effect of pig slurry was insignificant. Grain yield in the first wheat crop showed an average dry matter (DM) increase of 0.7tha21 after treatment with 8 and 12tstrawha21. In the two subsequent wheat crops, grain yield increased by 0.2–0.3tDMha21 after 8 and 12tstrawha21. No grain yield increases were found after 4tstrawha21 in any of the three years. Previous ryegrass catch crops increased yields of wheat grain, but effects in the third wheat crop were significant only where ryegrass had been combined with pig slurry. Straw incorporation increased the N offtake in the first wheat crop. In the second crop, only 8 and 12tstrawha21 improved wheat N offtake, while the N offtake in the third wheat crop was unaffected. Ryegrass catch crops increased N offtake in the first and second wheat crop. Again, a positive effect in the third crop was seen only when ryegrass was combined with slurry. Long-term, annual incorporation of straw and ryegrass catch crops provided a clear and relatively persistent increase in soil organic matter levels, whereas the positive effects on the yield of subsequent wheat crops were modest and transient "	Soil Use and Management	20		432-438	2020UPDTCCLAhdwymissed184a	"I.

From 1981 to 1988, these sites had received the straw incorporation treatments only. Grain yield on the sandy loam was unaffected by straw incorporation. On the sandy soil the highest straw application rates reduced grain yield in barley not given fertilizer. When the barley received 100 kg N, grain yield on this soil was also unaffected by the high straw rates. Including a catch crop had a positive effect on the grain yield of barley on both soils. The total N uptake in grain and straw generally increased with straw application up to 8 t. With the highest straw application rate, the total N uptake decreased but still exceeded N uptake in barley grown with straw removal. Barley accumulated higher amounts of N when a catch crop was included. The total N uptake in barley was significantly higher after slurry application. The extra N uptake, however, was much lower than the amounts of N applied with the slurry. Incorporation of straw had only a small influence on N uptake after slurry application. The straw, therefore, was not able to store that applied N during winter. In 1981-88, grain yield on the sandy loam was generally negatively affected by straw incorporation. The sandy loam soil showed higher increases in C and N content after the repeated straw incorporations and catch-crop growing than the sandy soil. When application of animal slurry was combined with the catch crop, no further increases in soil C and N were found relative to soil where a catch crop was grown without slurry application. Large amounts of the N applied with the slurry may therefore have been lost by denitrification or nitrate leaching."	"Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica.

Leithold"	2011	Relation between soil organic matter and yield levels of nonlegume crops in organic and conventional farming systems	"The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction between yield levels of nonleguminous crops and soil organic matter (SOM) under the specific conditions of organic and conventional farming, respectively, and to identify implications for SOM management in arable farming con- sidering the farming system (organic vs. conventional). For that purpose, correlations between yield levels of nonlegume crops and actual SOM level (Corg, Nt, Chwe, Nhwe) as well as SOM-level development were examined including primary data from selected treatments of seven long- term field experiments in Germany and Switzerland. Yield levels of nonlegume crops were posi- tively correlated with SOM levels, but the correlation was significant only under conditions of organic farming, and not with conventional farming treatments.
While absolute SOM levels had a positive impact on yield levels of nonlegumes, the yield levels of nonlegumes and SOM-level development over time correlated negatively. Due to an in- creased demand of N from SOM mineralization, higher yield levels of nonlegumes obviously indicate an increased demand for OM supply to maintain SOM levels. Since this observation is highly significant for farming without mineral-N fertilization but not for farming with such fertiliza- tion, we conclude that the demand of SOM-level maintenance or enhancement and thus ade- quate SOM management is highly relevant for crop production in organic farming both from an agronomical and ecological point of view. Under conventional management, the agronomic rele- vance of SOM with regard to nutrient supply is much lower than under organic management. However, it has to be considered that we excluded other possible benefits of SOM in our survey that may be highly relevant for conventional farming as well."

However, the consequences of this transition on soil quality (SQ) have scarcely been studied. Therefore, after previously identifying the most tillage-sensitive SQ indicators under long-term rainfed conditions, conversion of a research site on a Haplic Calcisol in Navarre, in northeast Spain provided an ideal location to reevaluate those SQ indicators after three years of irrigated management. The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) was used to test our hypothesis that adopting irrigation could change the sensitivity and importance of non-irrigated SQ indicators. Several soil physical, chemical, and biological indicators along with crop yields were used to evaluate SQ three years after initiating irrigation on a long-term conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT) study where either barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was being grown. The results confirmed our hypothesis that irrigation would change the relative importance of various SQ indicators and suggested that some SMAF algorithms, such as those used to assess bulk density, needed to be recalibrated for these Mediterranean soils."

The broadcasting and the short-term direct-drilling treatments were applied to previously chisel-ploughed and deep mouldboard-ploughed treatments, respectively. Autumn nitrogen treatments of 30 or 60 kg/ha and spring nitrogen treatments of 150 or 225 kg/ha were applied. The experiment is located on a cambisol (15% clay in topsoil) and on a gleysol (17% clay in topsoil) in Scotland. Straw was removed by baling and the stubble remained when the treatments were applied. Long-term direct-drilling yielded most over the 3 years of the experiment and was particularly successful after the unusually wet autumn and winter of the third season. Short-term direct-drilling was the lowest yielding treatment in the first season only. The success of the long-term direct-drilling treatment was associated with the development of a stable, protective surface tilth as a result of organic-matter accumulation. This was associated with some soil structural improvement deeper in the profile in the long-term direct-drilled gleysol as shown by measurements of air permeability. Crop performance was not related to soil compactness or cone resistance. The relatively high rates of nitrogen applied, both autumn and spring, gave worthwhile crop responses except for the third season, when the crop lodged. Short-term direct-drilling, broadcasting with rotovation and ploughing with drilling gave similar average yields on the gleysol, but on the cambisol broadcasting with rotovation outyielded the other two treatments by an average of 0.3 t/ha."

Nitrogen was top-dressed either at the recommended rate or at 40% greater than the recommended rate. The experiment was on a well-drained sandy loam containing 3.8% easily oxidisable organic matter, representative of many coarse-textured Scottish soils, and ran for three seasons during 1980-1983. Crop and soil conditions were measured frequently throughout the duration of the experiment. No significant differences in yield were detected between the cultivation treatments at either nitrogen level in any year. The mean yield for the three seasons at the recommended rate of nitrogen top dressing was 5.8 t ha<sup>-1</sup> which was increased, on average, by 0.72 t ha<sup>-1</sup> by the higher rate of nitrogen top dressing, a profitable response. Grain water content, weight, specific weight and nitrogen content were influenced little by cultivation treatment. The similar grain yields and qualities were consistent with the similarly satisfactory seedbeds produced by the cultivation treatments and the stable structure of the soil which, though moderately compact, was relatively weak and ensured that soil physical properties were similar in all cultivation treatments. Both primary and secondary cultivation requirements are low. Shallow ploughing to 100 mm gave a small yield benefit and may be the most suitable cultivation treatment. Soil disturbance below this depth is probably not necessary for winter barley on such coarse-textured brown forest soils."

Pulleman	2015	Soil physical quality in contrasting tillage systems in organic and conventional farming	"Reduced tillage can improve soil physical quality relative to mouldboard ploughing by lessening soil disturbance, leaving organic matter at the soil surface, and stimulating soil biological activity. In organic farming, continuous ploughing may negate benefits to soil structure and function from increased use of manures and more diverse crop rotations, which are particularly important components of organic farming. The current study examined soil physical quality (i.e., properties and functioning) of a 4-year old reduced tillage system under organic and conventional farming with crop rotations that included root crops. Reduced tillage was compared to conventional mouldboard ploughing (MP) in 2 organic fields at different points of the same crop rotation (Org A and Org B) and 1 conventional field (Conv A). Reduced tillage consisted of non-inversion tillage (NIT) to 18-23 cm depth whereas MP was characterised by annual mouldboard ploughing to 23-25 cm depth. NIT improved soil water retention in Org B but had no effect in Org A. NIT increased soil aggregate stability at 10-20 cm depth compared to MP in all fields, and additionally at 0-10 cm in Conv A. Penetration resistance was higher in NIT in all fields. Furthermore, soil organic matter content was higher in NIT than MP at 0-10 cm depth in all fields and at 10-20 cm in Org B and Conv A. NIT increased carbon stocks in Org B but not in Org A. NIT statistically increased crop yields in spring wheat/faba bean mixture in Org A, and there was no yield penalty from NIT in Org B spring wheat nor Conv A sugar beet. In contrast, field-saturated hydraulic conductivity in all fields in autumn was lower in NIT. Differences in crop (i.e., phase of rotation) and associated organic inputs between Org A and B likely accounted for the differences in effects of tillage system. Overall, the NIT system improved or imposed no penalty on soil physical quality (except field-saturated hydraulic conductivity) and improved or imposed no penalty on crop yields and could therefore be considered as a viable alternative for farmers."

The Lismore silt loam had been under long-term pasture before the experiment, whilst the Wakanui silt loam soil had been under long-term arable cropping.

At both sites, earthworm populations were greater under NT than CT. Yields of wheat tended to be greater under NT at both sites, but yields of spring barley were greater under CT. Under CT there was a flush of mineralization following cultivation, whist under NT mineralization was more evenly distributed over the growing season.

In 2002, two field experiments, each including four cash crop rotations, were established on soils with 9 and 15% clay, under temperate, coastal climate conditions. Direct drilling and harrowing to two different depths were compared to plowing with respect to yield, nitrate N leaching, and carbon sequestration. For comparison of yields across rotations, grain and seed dry matter yields for each crop were converted to grain equivalents (GE). Leaching was compared to yields by calculating yield-scaled leaching (YSL, g N kg(-1) GE), and N balances were calculated as the N input in manure minus the N output in products removed from the fields. Direct drilling reduced yields, but no effect on leaching was found. Straw retention did not significantly increase yields, nor did it reduce leaching, while fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L.) as a catch crop was capable of reducing nitrate leaching to a low level. Thus, YSL of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was higher than for spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grown after fodder radish due to the efficient catch crop. Soil organic carbon (SOC) did not increase significantly after 7 yr of straw incorporation or noninversion tillage. There was no correlation between N balances calculated for each growing season and N leaching measured in the following percolation period."

Dumont	2018	"Impact of crop residue management on crop production and soil chemistry after seven years of crop rotation in temperate climate, loamy soils"	"Society is increasingly demanding a more sustainable management of agro-ecosystems in a context of climate change and an ever growing global population. The fate of crop residues is one of the important management aspects under debate, since it represents an unneglectable quantity of organic matter which can be kept in or removed from the agro-ecosystem. The topic of residue management is not new, but the need for global conclusion on the impact of crop residue management on the agro-ecosystem linked to local pedo-climatic conditions has become apparent with an increasing amount of studies showing a diversity of conclusions. This study specifically focusses on temperate climate and loamy soil using a seven-year data set. Between 2008 and 2016, we compared four contrasting residue management strategies differing in the amount of crop residues returned to the soil (incorporation vs. exportation of residues) and in the type of tillage (reduced tillage (10 cm depth) vs. conventional tillage (ploughing at 25 cm depth)) in a field experiment. We assessed the impact of the crop residue management on crop production (three crops-winter wheat, faba bean and maize-cultivated over six cropping seasons), soil organic carbon content, nitrate (NO3-), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) soil content and uptake by the crops. The main differences came primarily from the tillage practice and less from the restitution or removal of residues. All years and crops combined, conventional tillage resulted in a yield advantage of 3.4% as compared to reduced tillage, which can be partly explained by a lower germination rate observed under reduced tillage, especially during drier years. On average, only small differences were observed for total organic carbon (TOC) content of the soil, but reduced tillage resulted in a very clear stratification of TOC and also of P and K content as compared to conventional tillage. We observed no effect of residue management on the NO3- content, since the effect of fertilization dominated the effect of residue management. To confirm the results and enhance early tendencies, we believe that the experiment should be followed up in the future to observe whether more consistent changes in the whole agro-ecosystem functioning are present on the long term when managing residues with contrasted strategies."

Saby	2018	Soil fertility after 10 years of conservation tillage in organic farming	"It has become commonplace to consider ploughing as an agricultural practice that destroys soil fertility. Organic farmers have traditionally used the plough to till their soil and control weeds. However, there is a growing interest in adopting tillage practices without ploughing to preserve long-term soil fertility and in the hope, subsequently, of increasing crop yields. The aim of this paper is to assess if conservation tillage treatments in organic farming did in fact improve long-term soil fertility, wheat rooting and yield in a long term field experiment (2004-2015). We compared the effects of conservation tillage treatments (superficial tillage - ST- with chisel at 15 cm depth and very superficial tillage - VST- at 5-7 cm depth) and conventional tillage treatments (traditional mouldboard ploughing- MP at 30 cm depth and shallow mouldboard ploughing - SMP- at 18 cm depth without skim coulter) during 10 years on a sandy loam soil in France. To assess soil fertility, physical (soil penetration resistance, visual soil profile observation), chemical (organic carbon - Corg, total nitrogen - Ntot and available phosphorus - OlsenP) and biotic (earthworms biomass, density and diversity) soil properties were measured in 2004-5 and 2015. The effect of soil fertility on wheat roots and crop growth was also measured in 2015. VST, and to a lesser extent ST, increased Corg, Ntot and OlsenP in the upper soil layer (from 0 to 15 cm) compared to ploughing treatments. On the contrary, soil compaction increased using conservation tillage treatments (VST and ST) during the 10 years of experiment, especially in the layers between 15 and 30 cm depth in comparison with ploughing treatments. This effect is not offset by an increase in earthworm abundance and activities in conservation treatments. Earthworm biomass and endogeic abundance were even higher in SMP compared to ST. Soil compaction limits roots, with less roots in depth with VST (from 12 to 30 cm and 48 to 70 cm) and ST (from 24 to 30 cm) compared to ploughing treatments. Conservation tillage treatments had positive effects on soil chemical components in the upper soil layer and contributed to the increase of wheat biomass until tillering stage. However, no wheat yield difference was found between treatments. Physical and biotic soil properties had not significantly improved after 10 years of conservation tillage. This could be due either to the insufficient duration of the experiment to foster a positive earthworm effect on soil porosity, or to the sandy soil, too sensitive to soil compaction in this organic cropping system (intensive mechanical weeding) and unfavourable for the development of the earthworm population."

Tillage treatments were deep moldboard plow: DP, 25 cm; double-layer plow; DLP, 15+10 cm, shallow moldboard plow: SP, 15 cm and chisel plow: CP, 15 cm, each of them with or without preceding stubble tillage. The mean yields of a typical eight-year crop rotation were 22% lower with CP compared to DP, and 3% lower with SP and DLP. Stubble tillage increased yields by 11% across all treatments. Soil nutrients were high with all tillage strategies and amounted for 34-57 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> P and 48-113 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> K (0-60 cm soil depth). Humus budgets showed a high carbon input via crops but this was not reflected in the actual C<sub>org</sub> content of the soil. C<sub>org</sub> decreased as soil depth increased from 13.7 g kg<sup>-1</sup> (0-20 cm) to 4.3 g kg<sup>-1</sup> (40-60 cm) across all treatments. After 12 years of experiment, SP and CP resulted in significantly higher C<sub>org</sub> content in 0-20 cm soil depth, compared to DP and DLP. Stubble tillage had no significant effect on C<sub>org</sub>. Stubble tillage combined with reduced primary tillage can sustain yield levels without compromising beneficial effects from reduced tillage on C<sub>org</sub> and available nutrient content."

In this paper, we evaluate the effect of continuous tillage and tillage conversion of NT to FIT and vice versa on SOC and SON stocks, in a long-term experiment at Boigneville in Northern France. Continuous NT (CNT) and FIT (CFIT) treatments were established in 1991 and maintained until 2011 while half of the plots were converted in 2005: from CNT to new FIT (NFIT) and CFIT to new NT (NNT). Bulk densities and organic C and N contents were determined in 2001 and 2011 down to the old ploughing depth (opd) which was also measured. SOC and SON stocks were calculated at equivalent soil mass by correcting either bulk densities or the opd. Both methods produced very close results and similar conclusions. A typical gradient of SOC and SON concentrations vs depth was observed in CNT as opposed to a rather uniform distribution in CFIT. CNT resulted in SOC concentration in the top soil (0–5 cm) higher by 38% in 2001 and 53% in 2011 compared to CFIT. Conversely, it led to a SOC reduction in the deeper layer (ca. 10–28 cm) by 14% in 2001 and 18% in 2011. The global effect was no significant change in SOC and SON stocks between treatments over the old ploughed layer (4060tsoilha−1) in both years: 43.2 and 45.0 t C ha−1 in 2001 and 44.7 and 45.8 t C ha−1 in 2011, in CNT and CFIT, respectively. In 2011, six years after tillage conversion, the stratification of SOC and SON had disappeared in NFIT whereas a new one had appeared in NNT with a smaller gradient than in CNT. SOC or SON stocks over the old ploughed layer did not differ significantly between treatments after 6 years of conversion: SOC stocks were 45.8, 43.2, 44.7 and 43.1 t C ha−1 in the CFIT, NFIT, CNT and NNT treatments, respectively. Furthermore, SOC stocks below the old ploughed layer (ca. 28–40 cm) were slightly greater in FIT than in NT treatment (10.9 vs 8.7 t C ha−1 ). In this experiment, continuous or conversion tillage did not result in any C sequestration benefit."
