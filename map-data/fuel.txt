The erratic path of the low-carbon transition in China: Evolution of solar PV policy	Energy Policy	0301-4215	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.12.063	http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151301327X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151301327X?via%3Dihub	"The last twenty years have seen the growth of both solar PV manufacturing capacity and deployment in China, yet this growth has followed a very erratic path. This study applies the concept of socio-technical regime to identify factors which have made this path so erratic. We examine four stages in China's solar PV policy from mid-1990s to 2013 and show that each is characterized by different combinations of policy program. These changes in government policy and in the resultant trajectory of the solar PV sector are attributed to three main sets of variables. The most important of these are events which shape the wider policy priorities of China's government. Secondary factors include the government's poor management of the policy interaction between the domestic solar PV manufacturing industry and the deployment of solar PV across the country, as well as policy learning within government. The general lesson from this study is that the development path of a single element of a national strategy for the low-carbon transition is likely to be erratic, subject as it is to a range of political and economic forces, and to experimentation and learning."	67		903-912	Solar PV; China; Low-carbon transition	China	39.9390731	116.1172814	Not Reported	0	N	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

Along with rapid economic growth over the last three decades, increasing rural households tend to use less biomass and more commercial energy such as coal and electricity. In this paper, we analyzed the key drivers behind energy consumption and switching by rural households based on survey data of energy consumption by rural households in ten villages of Shanxi province in China. Our econometric results show that income growth can induce less use of biomass and more use of coal and modern fuels. However, no evidence shows that even wealthy households has abandoned biomass use in Shanxi, mainly due to the ""free"" access to land and agricultural resources in these villages. Previous wealth of a household represented by house value can lead to more time spent on biomass collection. Access to land resources has positive effects on biomass use and collection. Other key variables include education, household size, the number of elderly members, and coal price. We also find huge differences between villages, indicating the importance of access to agricultural resources and markets."	3	4	576-591	Energy transition; Energy ladder; Energy stacking; Biomass; Rural; households; China	China	37.916276	112.573443	Rural	954	Y	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

Transition to cleaner household heating is associated with multiple benefits including improved environmental conditions and health of local residents. This study presents an analysis of data from an indoor survey covering 1030 households in 136 villages of Hebi City in the winter of 2018. The main purpose of this study was to reveal the key factors that affect cleaner heating choices under the national pilot program of the dual substitution policy, which targets the replacement of coal heating with gas and electric heating. The survey showed that electric heating is the most popular heating method, and the adoption of cleaner heating rises with income, and energy and device costs may be the major barriers to adopting cleaner heating. Further, multinomial logit regression was used to investigate the household factors and found that income, heating area, energy cost, and education had significant impacts on heating choices. In addition, the gas substitution policy was more effective in promoting the cleaner heating transition than was the electric substitution policy. Results show that more freedom to choose energies and devices, as well as infrastructure for gas supply and centralized heating, is also vital for the adoption of cleaner heating. Our study provides new insights to improve the details of implementation of the dual substitution policy."	249			Cleaner heating; Dual substitution policy; Environmental governance; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; AIR-POLLUTION; SUSTAINED EXPOSURE; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; LIFE EXPECTANCY; COOKING; DETERMINANTS; PATTERNS; IMPACT; TECHNOLOGY	China	35.74	114.3	Rural	1030	N	Energy - Fuel Transition	2018	2018	1	NR	N	NR		N	NR 				Neither

Decentralised combined heat and power in the German Ruhr Valley; assessment of factors blocking uptake and integration	Energy Sustainability and Society	2192-0567	10.1186/s13705-015-0033-0	https://energsustainsoc.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13705-015-0033-0	"Background: In Germany, the energy system is undergoing reorganisation from a centralised system based on fossil fuels and nuclear power to a sustainable system based on decentralised production and consumption of energy, the so-called Energiewende. Recently, there has been more attention to improving energy efficiency in those regions where conventional energy production activities and energy-intensive industries are located, such as the Ruhr area. Although the potential for decentralised combined heat and power (CHP) units is high in this region, local action plans show only modest developments for this technology. In this paper, we address this issue by answering the following research question: Which factors block the uptake and integration of decentralised CHP in the German Ruhr area's energy system? Methods: The multilevel perspective (MLP) was used to analyse the state of system innovation in relation to the uptake and integration of decentralised CHP technology. Prior to the MLP analysis, a stakeholders' analysis was conducted to identify stakeholders' views, positions and experienced barriers regarding the uptake and integration of decentralised CHP technology. Data collection included review of text documents and conducting 11 interviews. Results: Due to many regime barriers blocking niche development, the uptake of decentralised CHP technology is limited. Identified barriers relate to lack of market services and mismatches with user preferences, (sectoral) policies and industrial interests. Conclusions: Observed barriers relate to (i) lack of market services such as financial means for making investments; (ii) user awareness such as unawareness and information deficit regarding the benefits of decentralised CHP to potential users, (iii) the presence of centralised district heating systems, (iv) policy issues such as lack of sufficient policies supporting diffusion of decentralised CHP units, legal stipulations from social housing policies that prevent housing cooperatives from becoming energy producers and district heating systems owned by public and private owners (via concessions contracts); (v) sector issues such as lack of skilled service-providing companies; and (vi) industrial interested such as the vested interests of the coal and gas industry. Moreover, many of the mentioned barriers seem interrelated, especially those concerning policy and finance available for making upfront investments."	5	1		Energy transition; Decentralised CHP; Energy efficiency; Multilevel; perspective; ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK; RENEWABLE ENERGY; SUSTAINABILITY; TRANSITIONS; INNOVATION; SYSTEMS; INITIATIVES; NETHERLANDS; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE	Germany	51.48	7.52	Urban	0	N	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

Although in many countries, local and national governments have introduced incentives and subsidies to facilitate the electric vehicle market penetration, in Sweden, such benefits have been limited. Results from a survey carried out among private owners of electric vehicles are presented in this paper, including the analysis of the respondents socio-demographic characteristics, reasons for choosing an electric vehicle, charging locations and driving preferences, among others. The main results characterize current electric vehicle drivers as male, well-educated, with medium-high income; electric vehicles are used mainly for private purposes and charged at home during night time. Furthermore, the paper presents an analysis of the impact of large-scale penetration of electric vehicles on existing power distribution systems. The findings presented in this paper provide important insights for assuring a sustainable large-scale penetration of electric vehicles by learning from the experiences of early adopters of the technology and by analyzing the impact of different EV penetration scenarios on the power distribution grid.

Citizens' acceptance of the transition is important for it to succeed. We explored citizens' images of the future energy forms and energy system in Finland, and the drivers of a sustainable energy transition. The data gathered with an online questionnaire targeting an adult population 17-75 years of age (N = 1012) were analysed with exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regression. Four dimensions of future energy forms were identified: next-generation renewables, fossil energy, bioenergy, and established renewable vs. nuclear energy. Four dimensions of the future energy system were also identified: renewing the energy market, domestic power, small-scale producers, and consumer awareness. Five transition drivers were likewise identified: mainstreaming renewable energy, international actors, individual actions, changing values and economy, and emancipatory change. Mainstreaming renewable energy emerged as the key driver of transition, followed by individual actions. Generally, the sustainable energy transition was strongly supported by citizens' images, but different socio-economic groups preferred somewhat different images. Thus, the diversity of consumers' and citizens' roles in the transition needs to be acknowledged and encouraged in legitimate national energy policies. ‚àö¬¥¬¨¬© 2019 The Authors"	183		606-616	Citizens; Factor analysis; Image of the future; Renewable energy; Survey; Transition; Climate change; Economics; Energy conservation; Linear regression; Multivariant analysis; Population statistics; Surveying; Surveys; Exploratory factor analysis; Multiple linear regressions; National energy policy; Renewable energies; Small-scale producers; alternative energy; energy policy; fossil fuel; nuclear power; survey method	Finland	60.175501	24.937638	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	1012	N	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

In the case of solar home systems, recent studies report positive socio-economic effects on households, but technology adoption remains underwhelming. In collaboration with a local solar technology provider, we conduct a randomized controlled trial in 75 large villages in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India to examine the ability of village solar demonstrations to create markets for solar home systems. We find no effect of such demonstrations on technology sales, awareness, or perceptions of solar technology. Technology adopters report high levels of satisfaction with product quality and service, suggesting that the null finding cannot be attributed to poor technology. These findings suggest that lack of awareness is not a binding constraint on the growth of solar technology markets in the study area. Based on additional surveys, we find evidence suggesting that access to credit from rural banks is an important explanation for variation in sales across villages. These results do not prove that information and awareness are irrelevant in general, but they show that even carefully designed marketing campaigns cannot increase demand for new products in the presence of a binding credit constraint."	109		666-675	awareness; constraints; credit; electrification; information; innovation adoption; marketing; photovoltaic cells; renewable energy; rural areas; solar energy; technology transfer	India	26.54	80.49	Rural	750	N	Energy - Other	2014	2014	2	NR	N	NR		N	NR 				Drivers							Credit access is an excellent predictor of SHS sales in the area.

In 2017, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) conducted an evaluation of cooking practices among the beneficiaries of these stoves. Although almost 100% of households continue to use firewood for cooking, they cook an average of 58% of their food with LPG. Of the families that used to rely exclusively on firewood before 2011, 32% have now started to use LPG. Primary cooks _‚àö√´‚àö√¨almost entirely women_‚àö√´‚àö√¨ recognize the advantages of cooking with LPG and the health Problems associated with firewood use, with the primary barrier to using LPG being its high cost. Women spend 35-65_‚àö√´‚àö√£h a month preparing tortillas _‚àö√´‚àö√¨the main food cooked with firewood. The alternative store-bought tortillas are up to three times costlier. When given the opportunity to cook with LPG, families recognize its advantages and are incentivized to continue using it, despite its cost. The higher the socioeconomic status, the higher LPG use is. The authors suggest that subsidizing tortilla production could facilitate the exclusive use of LPG, avoiding the negative health impacts of firewood use and saving more than 25% of women's productive time."	133		110925	Clean energy; LPG adoption; Firewood use; Subsidies; Mexico	Mexico	17.294847	-93.0107957	Urban	190	Y	Cookstoves	2011	2017	0.1	6	N	N			NR 				Neither

A comparison of the drivers influencing farmers' adoption of enterprises associated with renewable energy	Energy Policy	0301-4215	10.1016/j.enpol.2012.06.043	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512005538?via%3Dihub	"A declared target of both the UK government and the European Union is to produce 15% of energy requirements from renewable sources by the year 2020; however the UK is very unlikely to achieve this. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has identified the potential amongst the farming industry to help meet this objective (DEFRA, 2007) but there is little published research on how organisations can successfully interact with farmers to achieve structural change. This paper reports the findings of a postal questionnaire survey of farmers in the West Midlands Region of the UK where principal component analysis revealed that personal, farm business, regulatory and behavioural drivers affected the rate of adoption of renewable energy (RE) enterprises. Of the 393 farmers who responded, 14% had adopted one or more enterprises associated with RE with solar energy production the most popular of the RE technologies available to farmers. The study found that the most influential personal level factors contributing to the adoption of RE and associated technologies were cognitive, such as level of education, but not administrative, such as the attractiveness of government schemes supporting RE and associated enterprises. Adopters also tended to be younger than non-adopters, perhaps reflecting the impact of long investment payback periods typically found with RE enterprises, they were involved with larger and more financially viable businesses that were more likely to trade as limited companies or family partnerships. Of current non adopters, 66% might decide to invest in RE technologies over the next five years. For these potential adopters, it emerged that personal, farm business and behavioural factors were the most significant drivers though contrary to expectation current non adopters assessed the policy support framework more favourably than current adopters. The explanation of this seems to be connected with timing, in that two very positive and encouraging signals in relation to Feed in Tariffs (2010) and the Renewable Heat Incentive (2011) were underway or near introduction before this research took place. The policy implications of these research findings are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Improved stoves have been promoted by development actors since the 1970s to alleviate various environmental and health problems associated with biomass use, with largely disappointing outcomes. Against this background, this paper examines the intervention of an international development organisation - Practical Action - in West Kochieng, Kenya, where the organisation's energy poverty alleviation efforts are aimed at addressing the health hazards of biomass smoke with six _‚àö√´‚àö√¢low-cost' improved cooking technologies. The study reveals that the cooking technology most valued by poor West Kochieng households is the one which most reflects their priorities, rather than those expressed by Practical Action. The findings point to three aspects of appropriateness of energy poverty alleviation interventions - technological, economic and cultural - which combine to influence acceptance and uptake of such interventions. The evidence highlights some of the limitations inherent in the generic policy recommendation to _‚àö√´‚àö√¢leapfrog' towards the resolution of energy poverty-related problems, and suggests that more measured steps which respond to the socio-economic realities of poor households are likely to engender more appropriate solutions."	47		202-210	Energy poverty; Improved stoves; Appropriate technology	Kenya	0.13	34.23	Peri-Urban	24	Y	Cookstoves	Late 1990s	2009	0.1	NR	N	N			Social 	Safety [Improved]			Drivers and Barriers				Cultural factors such as the need for an outdoor kitchen restrict the uptake of the smoke alleviation interventions	Technology that performed the best in terms of fuel savings had highest rate of uptake among studied technologies			"A woman involved in part-time sales of the interventions, suggests that initial cost is the major barrier to uptake"

Acknowledging the existing data constraints, a more focussed household energy survey was designed for rural India with the aim of better understanding determinants of current energy use patterns, energy choices, to measure the impacts of these factors, and importantly, arrive at key policy insights. This paper revisits the definition of access to include for reliability and quality going beyond conventional understanding. It also relooks at the role of gender in household energy choices. Having established that apart from income, socio-cultural factors may have a greater role in determining household energy choices, the model results indicate electricity access would have a positive impact on cooking energy choices only after meeting a minimum threshold requirement. As women move towards more formal employment, the odds of choosing cleaner fuels increase significantly. Thus, while macro-policies may provide important guidelines and the necessary framework, implementation strategies need to be designed at the local level through a participatory approach making energy an integral part of the development paradigm."	68		470-477	Energy access; Logit model; Household choices	India	23.26623	77.412062	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	0	N	Energy - Other					Y				NR 				Neither

Energetic communities: Planning support for sustainable energy transition in small- and medium-sized communities	A+BE Architecture and the Built Environment	22123202 (ISSN); 9789461866363 (ISBN)		https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988976412&partnerID=40&md5=f87f1884265ba492721e7f525d844a92	"The necessity for transition in the energy sector is beyond dispute and high on the political agendas. Climate change, the depletion of fossil fuels and the vulnerability of economies to resource speculation and unreliable political systems in the producing countries lay path for a broad implementation of smart alternative solutions. This means the integration of more sustainable renewable energy sources in the existing supply structures or the displacement of existing systems by new ones. Cities and communities are central players in the energy transition process. Energy demand is determined by the built environment. Renewable energy production needs space. The conflicts between different interest groups often break out in the context of local implementation measures that affect urban planning and the appearance of landscapes. Small- and medium-sized communities might prove to be game-changers in the overall energy transition because many problems have to be solved within their ambit. Urban planning is dealing with the numerous processes of urban change. Energy is a fairly new task to be addressed and many stakeholders lack experience and criteria for strategic decision making. After a period of fierce determination to turn the wheel against climate change, it seems that there is a growing resignation among politicians, planners and the public because some things have not turned out the way we'd expected and the hope for quick solutions fades. Rebound-effects seem to eat up the savings to a good extent, and alternative ideas of how sustainable energy systems may be put into place have not yet been persuasive in many cases. Energy systems have proved to be complex. They are still perceived to be important but in practice there is a growing uneasiness about the right steps to take. The overarching research question of this thesis is: What do decision makers in smalland medium-sized communities need to become more successful in implementing energy transition processes? For the research project this general question was broken down into four primary research questions: - How can communities anchor and monitor long-term energy transition visions in their communal development plans? - What tools and models are available for urban energy system analysis? - How can tools and models be adapted to the specific demands and boundary conditions in the case study communities to ensure long-term implementation of appropriate technologies and measures? - How does the practical implementation of the adapted tools work in the case study and what barriers must be overcome for long-term success? To answer these questions a combination of review of the current state of scientific literature of the thematic field with a practical application and evaluation of 'real' implementation projects was chosen. This appears to be a beneficial approach to scientific research in planning disciplines. The first research question is closely connected to urban planning and strategy. To anchor energy transition goals in these disciplines the potentials and consequences of political energy visions were studied. To monitor developments and progress existing indicator systems were reviewed and adapted to the needs of small- and medium-sized communities. For this overall target-definition the question of 'Exergy Thinking' in planning urban environments and energy systems was discussed. This basically means to create a deep understanding of the quality aspects in energy demand and supply systems and to be aware for better matching solutions. This approach opens many options for the integration of renewables in the heating and cooling supply. It showed that the definition of a clear long-term target or 'energy vision' supports the implementation of measures because it facilitates communication and controversy. The large number of available tools and scientific methods for the analysis and optimization of communal energy systems was reviewed to answer the second research question. The results from this work mainly led to the one central challenge that has to be solved whenever complex modelling and strategic decision making are affected: Data. Data describes the status-quo and gives necessary information on the complex system interactions and influence factors. The options to create a concise data framework for the central objective were addressed in two steps. From literature, existing models and approaches general data frameworks were collected and summarized. Since the method was to be applied to the test case study the data was validated and tested under the case study conditions. This showed deviations and necessary specifications but as well a good analogy to the default data. From this a transparent and adjustable spreadsheet-model was developed to create scenarios for the case study and to answer the fourth research question. To create a holistic picture of the communal energy system and the effects of increased exploitation of renewables geographic information systems (GIS) show very valuable functionalities. Especially since the processing and interpretation of geographic information is anchored in urban planning disciplines and creates an easy access if energy system information is integrated. The open data architecture of GIS allows the integration of different data types as long as they have a spatial correlation. This enables to retrieve valuable results from a scenario model even with rather fragmented and incomplete data. To show the effects of different implementation strategies represented by the different 'energy visions' three energy scenarios were run for the case study. These three scenarios represent central 'beliefs' or 'approaches' in energy transition as well as overall development indicators and specific local aspects. Therefore the success of energy transition measures remains limited if not all essential development parameters take a favorable course. The scenario evaluation shows some interesting results and shows the principal usability of the approach and the model. The base-case scenario shows that the community already reaches good results for the global energy indicators because of the existing measures. On a medium and long-term these measures are not sufficient though to stay on a good course. Especially the long-term developments in some cases produce unexpected results. For instance the rather unfavourable development of CO2-emissions in the renewable energies scenario was not a predictable result at first glance. Here the effects of the chosen technologies and the effects of superior developments show their impact. As well the huge impact of the assumed efficiency measures was somewhat unexpected. Even though the assumed refurbishment rates do not exceed national recommendations and the efficiency qualities are far from passive-house standard, the efficiency scenario shows the fastest and best results for the global environment indicators. This can be explained by the fact that the demand reduction optimally complements the existing renewable energy strategy and can show its full potential in this combination. The results of the smart-city scenario show the expected and desired trends of a moderate and balanced long-term strategy that leads to a slower but continuous positive development in all the analysed energy system indicators. The long-term trends of the scenarios and the effects of following 'plain' strategies can be visualised well with the model and the developed scheme. Therefore the initial research questions can be answered positively. The framework gives good and useful results and offers many options for future extension. Certainly the next and most important aspect to include into the framework is the question of costs and economic effects. The overall investment and operational costs for the measures in the different scenarios will be very different. Efficiency measures especially in the existing building stock are costly while the costs for PV-plants will most probably further decline. This is certainly a shortcoming for the efficiency scenario. A future study could as well look at overall economic effects of the diffe ent strategies for the benefit of the community. Basic figures on the economic effects of renewable energy systems are already available (Hirschl et al. 2010) and could be implemented. This would certainly make the framework more beneficial for communal stakeholders. The model is transparent and simple enough to go this way in the near future and the achieved results of this thesis project are a good basis for this. The realisation of energy systems as sketched in the smart cities scenario still demands some changes in the regulatory boundary conditions and some new technologies mainly in the information and communication technologies. Smart and electricity grid compatible buildings which can contribute services in grid stability are an issue still to come and contribute to the integration of renewable electricity. The integration of renewable heat in communal supply systems is a big future opportunity to realise LowEx potentials in the heating and cooling sector. Stakeholders in small- and medium-sized communities should be encouraged by the outcomes of the thesis to take initial steps on the energy transition path, since the results that can be reached with state-of-the-art technologies are very encouraging. Energy transition on a large scale depends on the local implementation. Despite the fact that public and scientific focus and attention is mostly on the megacities, it will be the countless small initiatives that will turn the tide."	5		372 pp.		Netherlands	51.3258929	9.1189017	Urban and Rural	6300	N	Energy - Other					N	Y	N		NR 				Drivers			engagement of innovative people and communication; scenario modeling adjusted to local specifications and development visions can be useful

As well as displacing fossil fuel consumption by increasing renewable energy generation, projects are expected to have a range of social impacts which may result in additional positive sustainability outcomes. These include potential to increase: acceptance of renewable energy developments; awareness of renewable and sustainable energy technologies and issues; uptake of low carbon technologies; and sustainable/pro-environmental behaviours. To date however, there has been little investigation of whether and how these impacts occur. This paper presents results from qualitative research investigating the social impacts of a community woodfuel project as experienced by project participants and other local stakeholders. Findings show projects can raise awareness of renewable energy technologies and increase uptake of renewables. Overall the case study project successfully changed the local social context for development of woodfuel heating, reducing risk for all involved in the future development of this sector, particularly in the immediate locality. There was some evidence of increased engagement with wider sustainability issues but this was limited to direct participants, suggesting local projects need to be supported by wider systemic change to maximise impacts."	42		239-247	case studies; community involvement; energy sources; fuel consumption; fuelwood; heating; renewable energy; social participation; stakeholders; sustainability	UK	54.41	-3.39	Rural	20	N	Energy - Fuel Transition	2004	2007	2	3	N	N		N	NR 				Drivers and Barriers			Providing visible demonstrations important in changing attitudes to woodfuel in community	Negative perceptions of woodfuel; Lack of local knowledge and installers				Complex grant system; High capital cost; Fossil fuels convenient;					Evidence that dissemination of learning via social networks can lead to uptake	Supply cost and reliability		No models for administration and operation of communal system;

They are manifested through growing demand for modern energy carriers, a fossil fuel dominated energy system facing a severe resource crunch, the need for creating access to quality energy for the large section of deprived population, vulnerable energy security, local and global pollution regimes and the need for sustaining economic development. Renewable energy is considered as one of the most promising alternatives. Recognizing this potential, India has been implementing one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. Among the renewable energy technologies. bioenergy has a large diverse portfolio including efficient biomass stoves, biogas, biomass combustion and gasification and process heat and liquid fuels. India has also formulated and implemented a number of innovative policies and programmes to promote bioenergy technologies. However, according to some preliminary studies, the success rate is marginal compared to the potential available. This limited success is a clear indicator of the need for a serious reassessment of the bioenergy programme. Further, a realization of the need for adopting a sustainable energy path to address the above challenges will be the guiding force in this reassessment. In this paper an attempt is made to consider the potential of bioenergy to meet the rural energy needs: (I) biomass combustion and gasification for electricity; (2) biomethanation for cooking energy (gas) and electricity; and (3) efficient wood-burning devices for cooking. The paper focuses on analysing the effectiveness of bioenergy in creating this rural energy access and its sustainability in the long run through assessing: the demand for bioenergy and potential that could be created; technologies, status of commercialization and technology transfer and dissemination in India; economic and environmental performance and impacts: bioenergy policies, regulatory measures and barrier analysis. The whole assessment aims at presenting bioenergy as an integral part of a sustainable energy strategy for India. The results show that bioenergy technology (BET) alternatives compare favourably with the conventional ones. The cost comparisons show that the unit costs of BET alternatives are in the range of 15-187% of the conventional alternatives. The climate change benefits in terms of carbon emission reductions are to the tune of 110 T C per year provided the available potential of BETs are utilized. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Household air pollution is harmful to human health, climate, and environment. Sustained uptake and use of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels are proposed as solutions to this problem. In this paper, we present our study protocol aimed at understanding multiple interacting feedback mechanisms involved in the dynamic behavior between social, ecological, and technological systems driving sustained use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies among the rural poor in India. Methods/Design: This study uses a comparative case study design to understand the dynamics of sustained use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in four rural communities of Rajasthan, India. The study adopts a community based system dynamics modeling approach. We describe our approach of using community based system dynamics with rural communities to delineate the feedback mechanisms involved in the uptake and sustainment of clean cooking technologies. We develop a reference mode with communities showing the trend over time of use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in these communities. Subsequently, the study develops a system dynamics model with communities to understand the complex sub-systems driving the behavior in these communities as reflected in the reference mode. We use group model building techniques to facilitate participation of relevant stakeholders in the four communities and elicit a narrative describing the feedback mechanisms underlying sustained adoption or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies. Discussion: In understanding the dynamics of feedback mechanisms in the uptake and exclusive use of cleaner cooking systems, we increase the likelihood of dissemination and implementation of efficacious interventions into everyday settings to improve the health and wellbeing of women and children most affected by household air pollution.

We conducted a pilot intervention promoting the purchase and use of an improved cookstove in rural Kenya. The goals of this qualitative inquiry were to understand the motivation to purchase and use; perceived benefits and challenges of cookstove use; and the most influential promotion activities for scaling up future cookstove promotion. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 10 cookstove promoters and 30 cookstove purchasers in the Luo community. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were transcribed and a thematic analysis conducted. Women reported the need for less firewood, fuel cost savings, reduced smoke, improved cooking efficiency, reduced eye irritation, lung congestion and coughing as major benefits of the cookstove. Cost appeared to be a barrier to wider adoption. The most persuasive promotion strategies were interpersonal communication through social networks and cooking demonstrations. Despite this cost barrier, many women still considered the improved cookstove to be a great asset within their household. This inquiry provided important guidance for future cookstove implementation projects."	9	5	1566-1580	improved cookstoves; developing countries; indoor air pollution; formative research; INDOOR AIR-POLLUTION; INTERVENTION; WOMEN; PNEUMONIA; IMPACT; TRIAL	Kenya	-0.5	34.67	Rural	40	Y	Cookstoves	NR	2008	1	NR	N	NA	NA	N	NR 				Barriers																		"Cost of purchase and installation of 'upesi jiko"" unaffordable to most families in their communities"		Several women said that they had no power to make any decision about purchasing improved cookstove

Understanding the determinants of household cooking fuel choice either to prefer clean or traditional energy sources is therefore important to identify policy options for clean energy promotion. For this, a nationally representative household information using Afghanistan Demographic and Household Survey 2015 is analyzed using multinomial logistic regression model. The results show that residence in urban areas, availability of electricity, higher household wealth, high education, married status and separate cooking place positively affect choice of liquefied petroleum-gas as compared to traditional fuels; whereas large family size and aged household head indeed have positive linkages on probability of choosing animal dung as cooking fuel. Robustness of the results shows that wealthy households are more likely to use liquefied petroleum gas and fuel wood compared to poor households, therefore confirm priority for wealth generation. For motivating the rural households to use clean-cooking-fuel, government and other cohorts should put effort on increasing affordability of rural households to clean energy sources through provision and employment opportunities, improving access to electricity and creating awareness about the health and environmental benefits of clean energy."	156		55-62	Cooking fuel; Clean energy; Afghanistan; Multinomial-logit; Choice probability	Afghanistan	34.560413	69.20047	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	24395	Y	Cookstoves					N				NR 				Neither

This paper compares the household energy transitions in these nations through the analysis of both aggregate statistics and nationally representative household surveys. The two countries differ sharply in several respects. Residential energy consumption in China is twice that in India, in aggregate terms. In addition, Chinese households have almost universal access to electricity, while in India almost half of rural households and 10% of urban households still lack access. On aggregate, urban households in China also derive a larger share of their total energy from liquid fuels and grids (77%) as compared to urban Indian households (65%). Yet, at every income level, Indians derive a slightly larger fraction of their total household energy needs from liquid and grid sources of energy than Chinese with comparable incomes. Despite these differences, trends in energy use and the factors influencing a transition to modern energy in both nations are similar. Compared with rural households, urban households in both nations consume a disproportionately large share of commercial energy and are much further along in the transition to modern energy. However, total energy consumption in rural households exceeds that in urban households, because of a continued dependence on inefficient solid fuels, which contribute to over 85% of rural household energy needs in both countries. In addition to urbanisation, key drivers of the transition in both nations include income, energy prices, energy access and local fuel availability. ‚àö¬¥¬¨¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Asian Develoment Bank biogas utilization project has supported construction of over 7500 biogas digesters in more than 140 rural villages. Additional 10 000 biogas digesters are programmed as well as significant investments in biogas production through large-scale animal agribusinesses. The latter will be supported through investments utilizing the Clean Development Mechanism. This paper looks at the project's Initial Environmental Examination undertaken at appraisal, assesses the ongoing energy and environmental monitoring plan currently under way, and examines the potential for the use of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for integrating environmental policy considerations on a regional or provincial level in China. Improved technologies for application of renewable energy - in particular successful application and adoption of biogas digesters at the village level - offer the potential to promote sustainable, cost-effective growth in agriculture with concurrent positive environmental impacts. Based on the relative success of ongoing efforts to promote the adoption of biomass technology, a significant expansion of the bioenergy programme is under consideration by the Ministry of Agriculture. The case study suggests that there is potential for use of SEA as a tool for the establishment of regional or provincial environmental priorities by taking account of information on the economic, social and environmental benefits, and costs and risks of adopting a national strategy for biomass utilization.."	18	4	396-412	anaerobic digesters; anaerobic digestion; bioenergy; biofuels; biogas; biomass; energy sources; environmental assessment; environmental impact; pilot projects; renewable energy; renewable resources; rural development; sustainability	China	39.91	116.42	Rural	0	Y	Energy - Other	NR				N				NR 				Neither

A fifth group served as a control (n = 2,377). Interventions were randomized across 32 villages in Wardak province. Outcomes were measured through two household surveys separated by one year and twice-weekly household surveillance conducted over 16 months. The households receiving all three interventions showed reduction in diarrhoea compared with the control group, through both longitudinal surveillance data (IRR [95% CI] = 0.61 [0.47-0.81]) and cross-sectional survey data (AOR [95% CI] = 0.53 [0.30-0.93]). This reduction was significant when all household members were included, but did not reach significance when only children under five were considered. These results suggest multi-barrier methods are necessary where there are many opportunities for water contamination. Surveillance data suggested a greater impact of interventions on reducing diarrhoeal diseases than data from the surveys. Higher economic status as measured through household assets was associated with lower rates of diarrhoea and greater intervention uptake, excepting Clorin.

This could have the twin benefits of reduced impacts on human health and deforestation. The aim of this study is to better understand the barriers to the uptake of ethanol stove technologies by eliciting users' perception, adoption, and use patterns of ethanol stoves. The study was undertaken in Maputo, a city that was the focus of the first large-scale commercial ethanol stove project in Africa. A mixed-methods approach was adopted using both quantitative (N = 341 household interviews) and qualitative methods (5 focus group discussions, expert interviews). Ethanol stoves are currently used by about 17% of the surveyed households, while approximately 12% had discontinued its use and 71% never used it. While a large proportion of ethanol users compared the stove favourably against charcoal in terms of cooking time, convenience, cleanliness, and easiness to use, ethanol use seems to have diminished compared to charcoal. Ethanol seems to have replaced other clean cooking technologies such as electricity or LPG rather than charcoal. High ethanol fuel prices combined with low fuel quality and accessibility, as well as stove malfunctions due to poor design influenced many ethanol stove adopters to quit it. For the effective uptake of ethanol, it will be necessary to address the factors that tend to discourage its use, particularly its high initial and operational cost, poor fuel quality, unreliable fuel supply, and poor stove design. Although clean cooking fuels might not be attractive to users due to affordability and failure to meet user preferences, awareness raising campaigns that target potential users should emphasise the associated health and safety benefits of clean cooking fuels. ‚àö¬¥¬¨¬© 2018 International Energy Initiative"	44		97-108	Cookstove; Cookstove Adoption; Ethanol; Mozambique; Charcoal; Deforestation; Ethanol fuels; Cooking technology; Low fuel qualities; Qualitative method; Sub-saharan africa; Users' perception; Stoves; cooking appliance; fuel consumption; perception; technology adoption; Maputo [Maputo (PRV)]; Maputo [Mozambique]	Mozambique	-25.9	32.54	Urban and Peri-Urban	341	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	2012	2015	1	3	N	NR		N	Social and Economic	Hygiene [Improved]; Convenience [Improved]; Safety [Worsened];Time Savings [Improved]	Inflation [Worsened]; Cost Saving [Worsened]; Cost Saving [Improved]		Barriers		Lack of fuel access cited as joint second most reason for discontinuation of use (12.3%)						"30% of Responders either would not use or would not buy ethanol burning stoves or ethanol fuel as ""both the stove and the fuel are expensive"". 47.4% Discontinued ethanol use due to economic reasons"						Stoves prone to breakdown cited as joint second most reason for discontinuation of use (12.3%)

Is it possible to substitute nonrenewable energy for renewable energy? What is the impact of renewable energy on the economy? This study primarily analyzes renewable energy development in Nigeria. Among other things, we estimate the economic impact, output elasticity, and the substitution possibilities of both renewable and nonrenewable energies. Our findings, based on a dataset from 1980 to 2015, in the framework of the translog production function, show that capital and labor are the main drivers of output in Nigeria; however, the economic impact of both energy types (renewable and nonrenewable) are insignificant, even though positive. With output and substitution elasticities being positive, this study confirms the possibility of moving towards a renewable power generation, but also highlights the limitation associated with such transition, citing inherent problems such as power density and scale, cost, and location. Based on Nigeria's economic and industrialization agenda, this study agrees with the respective strategies enshrined in the Renewable Energy Program but recommends that its implementation should be gradual and in accordance with Nigeria's economic goals. ‚àö¬¥¬¨¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd"	167		1181-1193	Economic growth; Nigeria; Renewable energy; Translog production function; Economics; Elasticity; Renewable energy resources; Economic growths; Non-renewable energy; Renewable energies; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy programs; Renewable power generation; Trans-log production functions; Economic and social effects; alternative energy; cost analysis; economic impact; industrialization; nonrenewable resource; power generation; resource development; strategic approach	Nigeria	6.530981	3.380767	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	0	N	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

Social marketing-with its focus on the marketing mix of promotion, product, price, and place-offers a useful way to understand household behaviors and design campaigns to change biomass fuel use. We report on a series of pilots across 3 Indian states that use different combinations of the marketing mix. We find sales varying from 0% to 60%. Behavior change promotion that combined door-to-door personalized demonstrations with information pamphlets was effective. When given a choice amongst products, households strongly preferred an electric stove over improved biomass-burning options. Among different stove attributes, reduced cooking time was considered most valuable by those adopting a new stove. Households clearly identified price as a significant barrier to adoption, while provision of discounts (e.g., rebates given if households used the stove) or payments in installments were related to higher purchase. Place-based factors such as remoteness and nongovernmental organization operations significantly affected the ability to supply and convince households to buy and use improved cookstoves. Collectively, these pilots point to the importance of continued and extensive testing of messages, pricing models, and different stove types before scale-up. Thus, we caution that a one-size-fits-all approach will not boost improved cookstove adoption."	20		28-42	INDOOR AIR-POLLUTION; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HOUSEHOLD ENERGY; IMPROVED; STOVES; HEALTH; BEHAVIOR; ADOPTION; BIOMASS; CONSUMPTION; TECHNOLOGY				Not Reported	0	Y	Cookstoves					N				NR 				Neither

Although now largely discredited, this assumption remains a foundation of laissez-faire policies that anticipate energy transition resulting spontaneous forest recovery with economic development. Our results suggest that such policies can undermine broader policy objectives and actually worsen forest conditions in rural Indonesia. Based on a case study of forest margin communities in eastern Indonesia, we demonstrate that fuel subsidy reform did little to reduce rural household demand for fuelwood, while dramatically increasing fuelwood demand for processing agricultural products. Our results show how household decisions related to fuel sources are affected by non-economic considerations and external factors, such as opportunities to sell fuelwood. We argue that policy interventions that encourage energy transition of households do not necessarily improve forest conditions, as household fuelwood use may be a symptom, rather than a driver of deforestation and forest degradation. Thus policies to improve forest conditions should focus more on addressing the market environment of forest-margin communities, providing energy alternatives to small industries that are often the larger consumers of fuelwood.

Although now largely discredited, this assumption remains a foundation of laissez-faire policies that anticipate energy transition resulting spontaneous forest recovery with economic development. Our results suggest that such policies can undermine broader policy objectives and actually worsen forest conditions in rural Indonesia. Based on a case study of forest margin communities in eastern Indonesia, we demonstrate that fuel subsidy reform did little to reduce rural household demand for fuelwood, while dramatically increasing fuelwood demand for processing agricultural products. Our results show how household decisions related to fuel sources are affected by non-economic considerations and external factors, such as opportunities to sell fuelwood. We argue that policy interventions that encourage energy transition of households do not necessarily improve forest conditions, as household fuelwood use may be a symptom, rather than a driver of deforestation and forest degradation. Thus policies to improve forest conditions should focus more on addressing the market environment of forest-margin communities, providing energy alternatives to small industries that are often the larger consumers of fuelwood.

"Adoption and sustained use of cleaner cooking fuels in rural India: A case control study protocol to understand household, network, and organizational drivers"	Archives of Public Health	07787367 (ISSN)	10.1186/s13690-017-0244-2	https://archpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13690-017-0244-2	"Background: Implementing efficient stoves and clean fuels in low and middle-income countries are critical for improving health of poor women and children and improve the environment. Cleaner biomass stoves, however, perform poorly against the World Health Organization's indoor air quality guidelines. This has shifted the focus to systematic dissemination and implementation of cleaner cooking systems such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) among poor communities. Even when there is some uptake of LPG by poor communities, its sustained use has been low. Concurrent use of LPG with traditional biomass cookstoves compromises reductions in household air pollution and limits health and environmental dividends. Therefore understanding key drivers of adoption and sustained implementation of clean fuels among the poor is critical. There is a significant gap, however, in the research to understand determinants and sustained exclusive use of clean fuels in rural poor communities. Methods/design: Using a case control study design, this study will explore the impact of affordability, accessibility, and awareness on adoption and sustained use of LPG among rural poor communities of India. The study uses a multistage random sampling to collect primary data from 510 households. Case group or LPG adopters constitute 255 households while control group or non-LPG adopters constitute the remaining 255 households. The study will deploy sophisticated stove use monitoring sensors in each of the stoves in 100 case group households to monitor stove use and stacking behavior (using clean and traditional systems of cooking) of participants for 12 months. Moreover, this will be the first study to explore the impact of personal social networks striated by gender on LPG adoption. This study is guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) implementation science evaluation framework. Discussion: Lessons from this study will feed into a larger discussion on developing a pro-poor strategy to foster uptake and sustained use of cleaner cooking systems such as LPG. Understanding the determinants of adoption and sustained use of cleaner cooking systems through the RE-AIM framework will expand our insights on implementation of cleaner cooking systems among poor communities and will advance implementation science in the clean cooking sector. A thorough study of such implementation strategies is crucial to realize multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals on global health, climate change, and energy security. ‚àö¬¥¬¨¬© 2017 The Author(s)."	75	1		Adoption; Cleaner cooking systems; Gender-based networks; Implementation science; Implementation strategies; LPG; Re-aim; Stove Use Monitoring Systems; Sustained use	India	13.23	79.09	Rural	510	Y	Energy - Other	NR	NR	NR	NR	N	Y	N	N	NR 				Neither

Despite the promise of improved cookstoves to reduce these impacts, adoption rates are relatively low. Using a 2-wave sample of 144 households from the baseline and first midline of an ongoing 4-year randomized controlled trial in Rwanda, we analyze the drivers and associations of early adoption of a household energy intervention marketed by a private sector firm. Households sign an annual contract to purchase sustainably produced biomass pellets and lease a fan micro-gasification cookstove with verified emissions reductions in laboratory settings. Using difference-in-differences and fixed effects estimation techniques, we examine the association between take-up of the improved cooking system and household fuel expenditures, health outcomes, and time use for primary cooks. Thirty percent of households adopted the pellet and improved cookstove system. Adopting households had more assets, lower per capita total expenditures and cooking fuel expenditures, and higher per capita hygiene expenditures. Households with married household heads and female cooks were significantly more likely to adopt. Adjusting for confounders, we find significant reduction in primary cooks' systolic blood pressure, self-reported prevalence of shortness of breath, an indicator of respiratory illness, time spent cooking, and household expenditures on charcoal. Our findings have implications for marketing of future clean fuel and improved cookstove programs in urban settings or where stoves and fuel are purchased. Analysis of follow-up surveys will allow for estimation of long-term impacts of adoption of interventions involving pellets and fan micro-gasification cookstoves. ‚àö¬¥¬¨¬© 2019, EcoHealth Alliance."	16	1	Jul-20	Africa; Biomass; Charcoal; Cookstoves; Household air pollution	Rwanda	-1.7	29.25	Urban	144	Y	Cookstoves	2015	2015	3	0	N	Y	Y		Social 	Human Health and Wellbeing [Improved]; Time Savings [Improved]			Drivers and Barriers	Households that adopted the Inyenyuri system had significantly more durable household goods (8.7) than non-adopters (6.9)		Over 65% household heads had heard of the negative impacts of cooking with biomass and more than 87% perceived some fuels and stoves to be less smoke-producing than others	Awareness of the environmental impacts of cooking with charcoal and other unsustainably harvested biomass was associated with significantly lower likelihood of adoption of the Inyenyuri's system (p=0.05)	We found a statistically significant negative association between adopting the improved household energy system and time spent cooking (p = 0.05)	"Even among adopter households, there was evidence of stove-stacking [no supporting data]"													Female primary cooks were significantly more likely to adopt stoves (p = 0.05)

More than 70% of total solar collector capacity worldwide is installed in China. The production of solar collector in China had decreased significantly from 64 million m2 in 2012 to 37 million m2 in 2017, corresponding to a reduction of around 40% of the market in 2012. There are very limited comprehensive studies in existing literature, which have investigated the reasons on the decline of Chinese solar thermal market. This study aims to identify the reasons from both the demand and the supply sides in details. Furthermore, with the rise of emerging markets, such as the rapid development of the _‚àö√´‚àö√≠Clean Heating Initiative_‚àö√´¬¨√π for space heating in North China, solar heat industrial process, and the mandatory installation of solar domestic hot water system for residential buildings below 100 m in urban area, the Chinese solar thermal market is expected to recover soon, called _‚àö√´‚àö√≠U-shaped curve_‚àö√´¬¨√π in this study. The market share of flat plate collector and evacuated tube collector is predicted to change in the near future. The research and development of flat plate solar collectors will increase continually in the market other than evacuated tube solar collectors like the past 10 years.

In this article we deploy three different approaches to understanding the role of scale; namely locational, relational and strategic rescaling. For the past decade, multi-scalar interventions by CEFE have provided a platform for community energy generation projects, facilitated by the development of social infrastructure that engendered new ideas, interactions and potentials, engagement and participation. These interventions have transformed the region's multiple, multi-scalar geographies of community engagement, energy use and climate change. Analysing CEFE assists in thinking about the relational aspects of energy demand, supply and use, as well as the spatiality of political mobilisation. As a grassroots movement that subsequently tried to scale up and out its activities, CEFE also alerts us to the relational nature of both barriers and opportunities for any transition towards a low carbon economy. Perhaps most significantly, the example of CEFE demonstrates how existing notions of the geographies of energy in Australia can be challenged and transformed. ‚àö¬¥¬¨¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd"	36		138-145	Community campaigns; Multi-scalar; Relational engagements; Social infrastructure	Australia	-32.51	141.04	Not Reported	0	Y	Cookstoves					N				NR 				Neither

Electricity generation capacity has increased from a total of 30MW in 1991 to over 130MW at present. The lengths of transmission and distribution lines have similarly increased from 150km to 400km and from 800 to 1300km respectively. However, as in most Sub-Saharan Africa, this public utility is characterised by inefficient managerial, technical and financial performances, an inability to mobilize the funds needed for expansion, low repair and maintenance capacity, inappropriate tariff rates, and inadequate revenue collection mechanisms. This has led the government to take appropriate reform measures in recent years, including the restructuring of the Eritrea Electric Corporation (EEC) to operate on commercial principles, setting tariffs based on real costs and reasonable profits, effective collection of revenues, the minimization of wastage and loss in the delivery of energy services, facilitating the private sector participation, and ring-fencing the interests of the poor by setting up a Rural Electrification Fund. A Regulatory body has been established to enforce these reform measures. Recognising the role of modern energy in poverty reduction and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Government with the support of its development partners is expanding energy services to rural areas in an innovative manner. The Government's commitment to diversify energy sources is exemplified by its agreement with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to share the costs of an on-going pilot wind energy project. It has also established an Energy Research and Training Centre to promote the application of renewable energies and improved biomass stoves throughout Eritrea."	15	2	178-189	Eritrea; Electricity sector reform; Poverty reduction				Not Reported	0	N	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

Cleaner-burning stoves reduce emissions and can have positive health, climate, and women's empowerment benefits. This article reports on the protocol and baseline data from the evaluation of four behavior change communication (BCC) campaigns carried out in lower to middle income countries aimed at promoting the sale and use of cleaner-burning stoves. Interventions implemented in Bangladesh, Kenya, and Nigeria are using a range of BCC methods including mass media, digital media, outdoor advertising, and inter-personal communication. The mixed methods evaluation comprises three large-scale surveys: one pre-BCC and two follow-ups, along with smaller scale assessments of stove uptake and patterns of use. Baseline results revealed varying levels of awareness of previous promotions and positive attitudes and beliefs about modern (i.e., relatively clean-burning) cookstoves. Differences in cookstove preferences and behaviors by gender, socio-demographics, media use, and country/region were observed that may affect outcomes. Across all three countries, cost (lack of funds) a key perceived barrier to buying a cleaner-burning stove. Future multivariate analyses will examine potential dose-response effects of BCC on cookstove uptake and patterns of use. BCC campaigns have the potential to promote modern cookstoves at scale. More research on campaign effectiveness is needed, and on how to optimize messages and channels. This evaluation builds on a limited evidence base in the field. ‚àö¬¥¬¨¬© 2017 by the authors.

Drivers and risks for renewable energy developments in mountain regions: a case of a pilot photovoltaic project in the Swiss Alps	Energy Sustainability and Society	2192-0567	10.1186/s13705-018-0168-x	https://energsustainsoc.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13705-018-0168-x	"Background: When renewable policies are in place, the mismatch between policy targets and lack of technology diffusion indicates a gap between codifying a policy and implementing it. In Switzerland, photovoltaic (PV) electricity is seen to play a major role in the future. Stakeholders' opinions in the implementation of photovoltaic projects may block or delay the achievement of renewable policy goals. This paper explores the question: which are the main drivers and risks perceived by stakeholders at different levels of the government in the implementation of a pilot PV project? Methods: We study a decision-making process of a pilot project in the Swiss Alps to figure out which determinants explain the public opposition to such implementation. We study five types of determinants of public acceptance: economy, technology, environment, social aspects, and the policy process. We use Q methodology, which is especially suited to determine the different interests of stakeholders' groups. Results: Our results show four different perspectives: ""Mainstream proponents,"" ""Ecologically wary,"" ""Worried about implementation,"" and ""Looking for cantonal and national backing."" The results indicate that the photovoltaics' acceptance was highly driven by the potential contribution of the project to the regional economy. However, economy and technology determinants elicited both the highest and the lowest statistical consensus among perspectives (z-score). Our results point out the important role of initiators to maintain trust during the decision-making process. Finally, stakeholders in the photovoltaic project wanted to have fluent access to concrete information about the project and its future plans. Conclusions: Most of the implementation risks observed are determinants of acceptance related to economic aspects and the policy process. Characteristics of the decision-making process, such as trust during the process, affect the perceived outcomes of the project. Aspects of the decision-making process may, therefore, turn into risks for the project's implementation. Results also suggest that techno-economic assessments are key drivers to fostering energy transitions, but they are not sufficient in themselves. Initiators have to consider enhancing communication since the early steps of the policy process, the intelligence and promotion phases to avoid implementation risks."	8			Q methodology; Stakeholder; Risk perception; Policy implementation; Photovoltaic (PV) power; Switzerland; APPLYING Q-METHODOLOGY; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; DECISION-MAKING; POLICY; ACCEPTANCE; PERSPECTIVES; IMPLEMENTATION; SWITZERLAND; PERCEPTIONS; LANDSCAPE	Switzerland	46.98	9.76	Rural	43	N	Energy - Fuel Transition	2011	NR	NR	NR	N	N	NA	N	NR 				Drivers and Barriers			Perceived environmental are indicators to be used in the promotion and codification phases of policy implementation				Economic value gain for village was a driver to support project	Implementation risks observed are determinants of acceptance related to economic aspects and the policy process of project						Implementation risks observed are determinants of acceptance related to economic aspects and the policy process of project

However, due to prevailing high price of non-edible oilseeds, such as Jatropha curcas, the cost of electricity generation is very high. This paper provides detailed financial analysis of straight vegetable oil (SVO)-based decentralized power project and proposes an innovative model for enhancing their financial viability. While for implementing agency operational cost recovery is the key for viability, affordable tariff is crucial for end-users. The paper attempts to estimate minimum desired price of electricity from the stakeholders' (producer and users) perspective using data gathered from selected operational SVO-based power generation projects in India. Analysis carried out in this paper indicates that operating the decentralized power plant at higher capacity utilization factor, by introduction of productive load, and differentiated tariffs for commercial and domestic consumers may not alone be sufficient to achieve the financial viability. The paper proposes an innovative integrated model of using biogas, obtained from the by-product de-oiled cake of non-edible oilseeds, as a feedstock for power generation, instead of using the SVO in engines. This reduces the fuel cost of power generation, thereby helping to bring down the tariff within the paying capacity of rural consumers. The main produce, viz. extracted non-edible oil, which was otherwise used as fuel for generating power, can be sold in local market for earning revenue, thereby enhancing the project's economic viability. This paper sets forth the proposed integrated model as a viable biofuel-based decentralized power project for sustainable rural development in areas with adequate availability of oilseeds."	19	1	263-283	biofuels; biogas; decentralization; economic viability; electricity generation; electricity supplies; energy sources; models; prices; rural areas	India	28.53	77.07	Not Reported	0	N	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

The replacement of fuelwood for LPG is the result of an intense urbanization process and governmental intervention based on price regulation and subsidies. In 2015, the energy demand for cooking in the Brazilian households was 46 TJ, LPG covered 51% of the demand and the remaining 49% relied on fuelwood to supply the demand for energy. This study shows that there are enormous variations in the level of consumption and the types of fuels used due to the regional complexity of Brazil. In addition, it also shows the transition from fuelwood for cooking to modern fuels such as LPG does follow a consistent pattern in Brazil.

Solar water heaters (SWHs) are a mature technology and the Taiwanese government has supported purchase-based subsidy programs during the last three decades. Some regional programs have also been implemented. The historical data shows that these programs definitely have a strong impact on the local market and the uptake of SWHs. However, the effectiveness of the long-term subsidy program is subject of debate. This paper comprehensively reviews the long-term subsidy program (2000-2015) in the local market.

Methods: A qualitative study with an ethnographic perspective was conducted in 2013/2014 based on 62 interviews with women who had participated in an improved firewood cookstove program in 2005. Thematic qualitative content analysis was performed. Results: Very few women from the indigenous communities were using the improved cookstove at the time of the study; the majority had dismantled or had ceased using it; whereas most of those from the mestizo community were using it for all of their cooking activities. In the indigenous communities, characterized by extended families, uptake of new technology was limited by traditional routine practices, rearrangement of rooms in the house, attachment to the traditional stove, a low- or non-risk perception of woodsmoke; gender relations, insufficient training, non-compliance with program recommendations and design-related aspects. Conversely, in the mestizo community, the uptake of the improved cookstove was favored by routine cooking practices in a nuclear family, a previous use of a raised cookstove and social representations on the health-disease-death effects of woodsmoke vs. the health benefits of cooking with improved stoves. The sociocultural dimension of communities and the cookstove design are aspects that either favor or limit the use of improved cookstoves in indigenous and mestizo populations. Conclusions: Effective cookstove programs must take these elements into account from their early planning stages, and blend them into implementation and follow-up. Project communication, training and differentiated follow-up activities ensuring the operation and maintenance of the cookstove, should be designed according to the specific needs and traditions of each community; they should be based on the preferences and needs of the users."	13	2	e0193238	cooking; dwellings; effects; follow up; fuelwood; guidelines; health; planning; rural areas; sociology; technology; uptake; women	Mexico	19.62	-102.22	Rural	62	Y	Cookstoves	2005	2005	2	7	N	Y	N	Y	Social and Environmental	Human Health and Wellbeing [Improved]; Convenience [Improved]		Environmental Pollution [Improved]	Drivers and Barriers	Improved cookstove does not release smoke				Functions with a small amount of firewood.

Further, health conditions resulting from household air pollution (HAP) are responsible for approximately 3.9 million premature deaths each year. Though transition away from traditional biomass stoves is projected curb the health effects of HAP by mitigating exposure, the benefits of newer clean cookstove technologies can only be fully realized if use of these new stoves is exclusive and sustained. However, the conditions under which individuals adopt and sustain use of clean cookstoves is not well understood. Methods: The Enhancing LPG Adoption in Ghana (ELAG) study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial employing a factorial intervention design. The first component is a behavior change intervention based on the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities, and Self-regulation (RANAS) model. This intervention seeks to align these five behavioral factors with clean cookstove adoption and sustained use. A second intervention is access-related and will improve LPG availability by offering a direct-delivery refueling service. These two interventions will be integrated via a factorial design whereby 27 communities are assigned to one of the following: the control arm, the educational intervention, the delivery, or a combined intervention. Intervention allocation is determined by a covariate-constrained randomization approach. After intervention, approximately 900 households' individual fuel use is tracked for 12 months via iButton stove use monitors. Analysis will include hierarchical linear models used to compare intervention households' fuel use to control households. Discussion: Literature to-date demonstrates that recipients of improved cookstoves rarely completely adopt the new technology. Instead, they often practice partial adoption (fuel stacking). Consequently, interventions are needed to influence adoption patterns and simultaneously to understand drivers of fuel adoption. Ensuring uptake, adoption, and sustained use of improved cookstove technologies can then lead to HAP-reductions and consequent improvements in public health.

Spanish RES cooperatives, unlike other European countries, are few in number. Here, we review their development by applying the Multi-Level Perspective approach. Spanish RES cooperatives have recently come up against a hostile regulatory and economic context, which has induced specific organizational and operating structures such as the application of innovative participation methods and investment tools. Spanish RES cooperatives regularly collaborate in sharing learning processes and experiences, having also demonstrated their capacity to spread new ideas at both social and political levels. However, despite their growth and territorial spread over the last few years, RES cooperatives still have a minor presence in the Spanish energy system. Although some internal factors may limit their potential as an active instrument towards the transition to RES in the country, the regime's resistance is found to be the main barrier.

The CE was followed by a contingent valuation (CV) question. Differences in willingness to pay (WTP) for the same filter design were tested between methods, as well as urban and rural samples. Results: The CV follow-up approach produces more conservative and statistically more efficient WTP values than the CE, with only limited indications of anchoring. The effect of the new filter technology on children with diarrhea is among the most important drivers behind choice behavior and WTP in both areas. The urban sample is willing to pay more in absolute terms than the rural sample irrespective of the valuation method. Rural households are more price sensitive, and willing to pay more in relative terms compared with disposable household income. Conclusion: A differentiated marketing strategy across rural and urban areas is expected to increase uptake and diffusion of the new filter technology. Background: Access to safe drinking water has been on the global agenda for decades. The key to safe drinking water is found in household water treatment and safe storage systems. Objective: In this study, we assessed rural and urban household demand for a new gravity-driven membrane (GDM) drinking-water filter. ‚àö¬¥¬¨¬© 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."	13	1	81-94	"drinking water; adult; Article; contingent valuation; diarrhea; economic evaluation; female; filter design; follow up; gravity driven membrane filter; household; human; Kenya; male; marketing; membrane filter; rural area; technology; urban area; urban rural difference; water quality; water treatment; comparative study; economics; filtration; micropore filter; rural population; socioeconomics; standards; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; urban population; Humans; Micropore Filters; Models, Statistical; Socioeconomic Factors"	Kenya	-0.29	36.09	Urban and Rural	300	N	Water	2012	2012	1	NR	N	Y	N	N	NR 				Neither

Not only is LPG a relatively clean, safe and cost-effective fuel for households, its large-scale adoption also reduces the heavy burden of kerosene consumption subsidies on government budgets. Against this background, we evaluate the impact of a large government program to substitute LPG for kerosene in Indonesia. Using a household survey across urban, suburban and rural regions we find that this program was very effective in causing a large scale shift from kerosene to LPG. This shift was positively influenced by level of education, household size and household income. Contradicting the energy-ladder model, the LPG program, reinforced by an increase in the price of kerosene, led to increased stacking of fuels, including increasing consumption of both electricity and traditional biomass. In addition, our analysis shows that the LPG program failed to substantially reduce the overall number of energy-poor people, but it has been effective in alleviating extreme energy-poverty. Finally, we find that medium and higher income households in suburban areas benefitted most from the LPG program."	66		436-449	Clean cooking fuels; LPG; Fuel switching; Impact evaluation; Energy poverty	Indonesia	-7.21	110.39	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	550	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	2007	2009	0.2	1	N	NR		N	Social and Economic	 	Fuel Use [No Change]		Drivers and Barriers	It can be seen that the decision whether or not to adopt LPG is positively influenced by education level	*See Notes		Relative user price (target technology considered expensive even though in reality it is relatively cheap) - key barrier to adoption.

The rural population is concerned about (i) exploitative businesses practices and (ii) the inequality that solar power in villages is more expensive than conventional grid power in urban areas. These findings show that the social acceptance of new, sustainable energy technologies cannot be taken for granted in rural development and offer insights into the salience of different varieties of concerns."	113		466-477	energy sources; rural areas; rural population; rural urban relations; solar energy; sustainability; technology	India	20.18	82.19	Rural	3208	N	Energy - Fuel Transition	[In Supplementary]			[In Supplementary]	N	Y	Y	Y	NR 				Neither

Barriers and facilitators to adoption and use of fuel pellets and improved cookstoves in urban Rwanda	PloS one	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0203775		"Background - The environmental and health impacts of reliance on solid fuels and traditional cookstoves in low-income countries have motivated the promotion of household cooking energy systems that use cleaner burning fuels and cookstoves that lead to reduced exposure to harmful pollutants. Little is known about adoption and use of such systems from the users¬¨√™ perspective. Methods - We explored the facilitators and barriers to adoption and use of a private sector marketed household cooking energy system that uses sustainably produced biomass pellets and the cleanest burning fan micro-gasification stove currently available. We conducted 48 in-depth qualitative interviews in Gisenyi, Rwanda with decision-makers and cooks in 16 households that adopted the improved cookstove system and 8 non-adopter households. Results - Reported facilitators and barriers to adoption and non-adoption, as well as use and non-use were complex, and in some cases, contradictory. Some adopters noted that cleanliness and low smoke production were major facilitators to adoption and use, while other adopters and non-adopters said the cookstoves blackened and damaged cooking pots and produced excessive smoke. Our findings suggest that correct use of the stove mediates user experience. Cost was likewise reported as a facilitator among some adopters and a barrier among other adopters and non-adopters. Peer influence played a significant role as both a barrier and a facilitator to adoption and transcended other factors. Positive peer influence describing the cleanliness, affordability, and efficiency of the cookstove system encouraged adoption and use, while negative comments by peers regarding excessive smoke and damaged cooking pots discouraged adoption. Commentaries by some participants suggest that inadequate training and instruction may be primary causes of the discrepancies. Conclusion - Cost, cleanliness, communication among peer networks, and adequate training and instruction are important factors associated with the adoption and use of improved cookstoves and should be prioritized in the implementation of improved cookstove programs."	13	10	e0203775		Rwanda	-1.678	29.257	Urban	24	Y	Cookstoves		2016	1	1	N	Y	N		NR 				Drivers and Barriers			peer encouragement	peer discouragement	time saving; low smoke production; cleanliness	damage to cooking pots; excessive smoke production	cost savings	cost- start-up costs; fuel costs rising; purchasing protocol								overcooked food

The aim of the RLP is to contribute to Ghana's overarching goal to provide LPG access to 50% of Ghana's population by 2020. The RLP has not announced long-term program objectives. However, in the interim the RLP targeted a cumulative total of 170,000 LPG cookstoves to rural households by the end of 2017. As of November 2017, 149,500 rural households had received the LPG cook stoves. Our case study documents Ghana's experiences to date with LPG scale up. Methods We carried out a desktop review/document analysis of literature on the RLP. Each document was reviewed for information related to the elements of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework as it pertained to LPG promotion and adoption. In-depth interviews were held among key stakeholders in Ghana. Previously collected data from a field evaluation of the RLP was also assessed. Findings Generally, our evaluation suggests that the current form of the RLP is not achieving its stated goal. Our evaluation of the RLP in five rural communities showed that about 58% of households had never refilled their LPG cylinders nine months after the initial delivery of a filled cylinder. Only 8% still used their LPG at 18_‚àö√´‚àö√£months post distribution. Cost and distance to LPG filling stations were the main reasons for low LPG use. Beneficiaries did not exclusively use their LPG even at the initial stages when all of them had LPG in their cylinders. Ghana is currently undergoing transitions in the LPG sector including a change from the current private cylinder ownership model to a cylinder recirculation model for the distribution of LPG. There was no evidence of a well-documented implementation framework for the RLP. Conclusion Fuel cost, poor LPG access, and an inadequate implementation framework hinder the RLP implementation."	46		94-102	LPG; Rural LPG promotion; LPG scale-up; RE-AIM framework	Ghana	7.68	-1.67	Rural	200	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	2013	2015	1	3	N	N			Social and Environmental	Human Health and Wellbeing [No Change]		Emissions Within Homes [No Change]	Barriers		Seasonality of respondent income (farmers) challenged adoption and sustained use of LPG						"Financial constraint major barrier to farmers, owing to to lack of regular source of income to support LPG purchases"

However, knowledge about the environmental impacts of traditional bioenergy is fragmented. This review addresses several persistent questions and summarizes recent research on land cover change (LCC) and pollution emissions resulting from traditional bioenergy use. We also review recent studies analyzing transitions from traditional bioenergy to cleaner stoves and fuels. Between 27 and 34% of the wood fuel harvest in 2009 was unsustainable, with large geographical variations. Almost 300 million rural people live in wood fuel ?hotspots,? concentrated in South Asia and East Africa, creating risks of wood-fuel-driven degradation. Different fuels and stoves show variation in climate-forcing emissions. Many, but not all, nontraditional stoves result in lower emissions than traditional models. Traditional bioenergy makes substantial contributions to anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emissions (18?30%) and small contributions to total anthropogenic climate impacts (2?8%). Transitions from traditional fuels and devices have proven difficult. Stacking, i.e., the use of multiple devices and fuels to satisfy household energy needs, is common, showing the need to shift stove interventions from the common approach that promotes one fuel and one device to integrated approaches that incorporate deep understanding of local needs and practices, and multiple fuels and devices, while monitoring residual use of traditional technologies."	40	1	121-150					Not Reported	0	N	Water					Y				NR 				Neither

The continuing importance of household use of biomass energy in urbanizing communities in Northeast Thailand	Biomass and Bioenergy		https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.06.046		"Following the energy ladder model, the role of biomass energy will diminish and even disappear as rural communities become more urbanized. However, the alternative fuel stacking model suggests that, as households become more urbanized, they diversify their energy sources while continue using firewood and charcoal. This study aimed to assess the extent to which biomass energy still plays an important role as a source of energy for household consumption across the urbanization spectrum of communities. Three villages in Khon Kaen province in Northeast Thailand representing the rural, suburban and urban communities were selected for study. Data were collected on energy uses at household level using a formal questionnaire survey along with field observation and field measurement. The results showed that total household energy consumption increased with urbanization. The absolute quantity of biomass energy used slightly increased when going from rural (5.52 GJ caput_1 y_1) to suburban (6.06 GJ caput_1 y_1) but greatly decreased for urban community (1.98 GJ caput_1 y_1), while the relative share declined with greater urbanization, being 46.2, 37.4 and 10.2% for the rural, suburban and urban communities, respectively. Both firewood and charcoal were used primarily for cooking, with a small amount used for home industry. It was concluded that, although the share of biomass energy in household energy portfolios does decline relative to modern energy sources in the course of urbanization, as predicted by the energy ladder model, there is no sharp discontinuity in utilization of energy sources between communities at different stages of urbanization and biomass continue to be an important component of household energy portfolios in all communities, supporting the fuel stacking model. It appears likely that biomass will remain an important source of household energy in Thailand for an extended period."	10		4180-4188	Household energy consumption; Firewood; Charcoal; Rural-urban continuum; Biomass energy; Fuel stacking	Thailand	16.3629226	101.906853	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	288	Y	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

All residents in the three villages cook with fuel wood, and between 20 and 43% of them also use LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) for this task, depending on the village. Average household fuel wood demand ranges between 53 and 60 GJ/yr for fuel wood only users and from 40 to 57 GJ/yr for mixed fuel wood-LPG users, depending on the village. Cooking practices are described together with their energy use. Kitchen performance tests and controlled cooking tests (CCT) were applied in two villages to measure savings in household fuel wood use from partially switching to LPG. The analysis shows that energy and fuel wood savings are much lower than those that may be expected on a purely technical basis. In fact, fuel wood is very seldom replaced entirely, even in households that have been using LPG for many years. Rather than switching, households follow a multiple fuel strategy which gives them the advantages of both fuels. There is a strong pattern of fuel preferences by type of dish and cooking task. Fuel wood is seen as a fuel with advantages that go beyond price and include cultural considerations. Lorena-type improved woodburning cookstoves might prove particularly useful for multiple fuel users as they show savings of up to 50% for tortilla-making compared with the traditional stoves in CCT."	12	5	437-361	Rural energy; fuel wood; inter-fuel substitution; fuel switching; Mexico; household energy; cooking tests; LPG	Mexico	19.8499177	-102.0721056	Rural	0	Y	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

Factors determining household fuel choice in Guatemala	Environment and Development Economics		"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X04001858"""		"This paper discusses the factors guiding household choices of cooking fuels. This is crucial for policies to combat indoor air pollution. Household income is an important, but not the only, factor. Opportunity costs of firewood also play an essential role. Empirical results are based on the 2000 Guatemalan LSMS survey, which includes a detailed section on energy use. Patterns of fuel use, energy spending, Engel curves, multiple fuels, the extent of fuel switching, and the determinants of fuel choice are analyzed. It is common in Guatemala to use multiple fuels for cooking _ 48 and 27 per cent of urban and rural households do so. Modern fuels are often used alongside traditional solid fuels; modern fuels thus fail to displace solid fuels in many cases, particular in rural areas and the urban bottom half. This is paradoxical since a significant share of firewood users buy wood from the market, incurring costs that are substantial, also in comparison with the costs of modern fuels."	10	3	337_361		Guatemala	14.6262096	-90.5626008	Urban and Rural	7276	Y	Energy - Other		2000			Y				NR 				Neither

A long-term comparative end-use analysis for Cheranatzicurin village, Mexico"	Energy for Sustainable Development		https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2013.05.004		"A detailed analysis of the change in the patterns of energy use in a Mexican village, from the year 1986 to 2012 is presented. The satisfaction of energy needs is analyzed according to the first- and second-law efficiencies of thermodynamics, for a total of 22 end-uses. The analysis covers both the end-use devices used for energy conversion and the energy and exergy used in the related thermodynamical tasks. The final energy per capita was 11.0 GJ/year in 2012, about 10% less than in 1986. In the study period, the overall first-law efficiency of the community increased from 17% to 23%, while the second-law efficiency rose from 6.4% to 8.2%. The increments in useful energy and minimum exergy (total and per capita), relative to 1986, occur at the expense of a small increase in the per capita consumption of final exergy of the community. The rise of both energy efficiencies is a consequence of the reduction in fuelwood consumption and on the use of draft-animals, whose conversion efficiencies into final energies and useful work are extremely low. Also, there is 314% increase in the village's fossil fuel use, especially due to an increase in the penetration of gas and electric appliances into the household sector and of vehicles. The energy use in the productive sector including agriculture fell dramatically. CO2 emissions from the community's energy use rose by 279%. Despite the increase of commercial energy use, and a rapid penetration of LPG cookstoves, fuelwood still represents 68% of the village final energy consumption. Also, there is a large mismatch between sources and needs in thermodynamic terms: while 72% of the energy needs correspond to work and heat at less than 100 ¬¨√ßC, 99% of the energy sources imply combustion processes (fuelwood, LPG, gasoline and diesel) to mid and high temperatures. However, in order to reduce CO2 emissions, the electricity and transport devices have to increase their efficiencies, and primary energy ought to come in higher proportion from renewable sources."	17	5	463-470		Mexico	19.7008917	-102.018557	Rural	0	Y	Energy - Other					N				NR 				Neither

[FIREWOOD CONSUMPTION IN THE RURAL AREA OF THE CANTON COTACACHI, AND PROPOSAL OF ENERGY PLANTATIONS]"				http://repositorio.utn.edu.ec/handle/123456789/814	"La investigacion titulada‚àö√Ü Consumo de le_a en el ‚âà¬∞rea rural del Canton Cotacachi, y propuesta de plantaciones energ_ticas‚àö√Ü cuyos objetivos son: Identificar las especies forestales de mayor demanda en el ‚âà¬∞rea de estudio, empleadas como le_a para la produccion de energia a nivel familiar y organizacion grupal. Identificar el tipo de combustible que com‚àö√≠nmente utiliza la gente para la cocina, su frecuencia y relacion con el consumo. Identificar las dietas alimenticias prototipo de las familias y su relacion con el consumo de le_a. Determinar el consumo de le_a promedio por unidad familiar y per c‚âà¬∞pita (por persona), expresado en est_reos y/o metros c‚àö√≠bicos, y/o toneladas m_tricas. Definir una propuesta de plantaciones energ_ticas en base a necesidades que demanden los usuarios. Esta investigacion se ejecuto en las parroquias de Seis de Julio de Cuellaje; Plaza Guti_rrez; Pe_aherrera y Apuela, que se las agrupo como Zona 1; Garcia Moreno y Vacas Galindo, como Zona 2; y como Zona 3, Imantag y Quiroga; las mismas que se las definio en base a sus caracteristicas ecologicas, socioculturales, viales y tipo de cocina. Para evaluar el consumo de le_a se aplico una cobertura del 1 % de las unidades familiares o sea 56 unidades familiares (puntos de muestreo), distribuidos a trav_s de una frecuencia relativa que se apoya en el n‚àö√≠mero de familias por parroquia. La toma de datos se efectuo durante seis meses, una vez por semana a cada unidad familiar. Para obtener el volumen de consumo en est_reos se utilizo las dimensiones de altura, ancho y profundidad de la carga de le_a. Fue necesario calcular los factores de conversion de volumen est_reo a volumen solido; que se obtuvo midiendo cada uno de los palos que integraron la carga. Se determino el volumen solido, que dividido para el volumen est_reo permitio el calculo de los respectivos factores de conversion para las tres zonas. El volumen en metros c‚àö√≠bicos se transformo a toneladas m_tricas y por ‚àö√≠ltimo a kilogramos. El resultado final fue kilogramos por persona y por dia, ya que a nivel mundial este consumo se cuantifica en relacion de peso y no de volumen. En cada carga se identifico las especies y luego se clasifico a nivel de g_nero y cuando fue factible se determino la especie. Con fines de transformacion de las unidades expresadas en volumen (m3) se transformo a peso (Toneladas m_tricas); consecuentemente fue necesario calcular el peso especifico seco al horno. Con estos valores se determino cuantos kilogramos consume cada unidad familiar (kg/per/dia). Los resultados se proyectaron a un a_o calendario y luego se determino la necesidad de formular una propuesta de plantaciones energ_ticas. Del estudio realizado se desprende que, las especies de mayor demanda para le_a son: ARALIACEAE Oreopanax spp. Pumamaqui ASTERACEAE Baccharis spp. Chilca BIGNONACEAE Delastoma integrifolia Rose ex. Rudd Yaloman LAURACEAE Ocotea spp. Aguacate MIMOSACEAE Inga spp. Guabo MIMOSACEAE Calliandra pittieri Standl Tura MIRCINACEAE Rapanea spp. Tupial MYRTACEAE Eucalyptus globulus labill Eucalipto PIPERACEAE Piper spp Cordoncillo El consumo de le_a por persona en est_reos, metros c‚àö√≠bicos y kilogramos por dia y por a_o fueron los siguientes: CONSUMO Metros estereos/persona/a_o 2.61 m3/persona/a_o 1.23 kg/persona/dia 2.064 kg/persona/a_o 753.31 Ton m/familia/a_o 2.944 La relacion entre consumo de le_a y gas es de 70% a 30% respectivamente. Los tipos de estufa que utilizan para cocinar son varilla, fogon y tres piedras, siendo la mas frecuente la de varilla. Para satisfacer los requerimientos de le_a de manera continua en el Canton Cotacachi se debe plantar en cercas vivas 55 Km/a_o con Eucaliptos grandis (Hill) Maiden y Alnus acuminata H.B.K.; y 50 Ha/a_o de masas puras con Eucaliptos globulus Labill, bajo un ciclo de rotacion de cinco a_os logrando asi una produccion sostenida de 19 902.14 m3/a_o."

The main reasons people thought that Pika Poa was more expensive for them, included that some of these users were collecting firewood previously and weren‚àö√ßt spending any money on fuel before but were now having to spend money on pellets. Whereas this was more expensive for them they valued other factors about the fuel such as the time saving and convenience of purchase."

This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies. Objective To review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP). Methods and data sources Searches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys. The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach. Results The main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia. Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used. Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015. Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households. While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited. Conclusions Addressing HAP and the health impacts associated with kerosene and biomass use was never an objective of the program. Consequently, there is limited evidence of impact in this area, and in hindsight, missed opportunities in terms of influencing cooking behaviour change among biomass users, who are more at risk."	46		71-81	LPG; Kerosene; Clean fuels; Clean cooking; Fuel subsidies	Indonesia	-6.2	106.82	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	6	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	2007	NR	NR	10	N	Y	Y	Y	NR 				Drivers and Barriers	Positive correlation between level of education and LPG adoption.

Natural gas and electricity: Two perspective technologies of substituting coal-burning stoves for rural heating and cooking in Hebei Province of China	Energy Science & Engineering		10.1002/ese3.263		"Coal not only powers the household, social and global economy development but also emits large pollutants. Natural gas and electricity can be promising solutions to the energy supply and environmental pollution dilemma in Hebei Province of China. Currently, this coal_‚àö√´¬¨√™dependent province has launched the Hebei Air Pollution Prevention and Control Program to curb air pollution by replacing residential coal consumption with natural gas and electricity for space heating in winter. Approximately 2.53 million households have completed the switch from coal_‚àö√´¬¨√™burning stoves to natural gas or electricity stoves in rural areas surrounding Beijing and Tianjin since 2017. However, the contribution of this clean heating replacement on provincial emission reduction remains unclear. This study aimed to determine emission factors, energy efficiency, and economic profits of traditional coal_‚àö√´¬¨√™burning stoves, as well as cleaner natural gas and electricity stoves by laboratory simulation and field tests. The results indicated a significant reduction after clean replacement for PM2.5, CO, CO2, NOX, SO2, CH4, and 16 types of U.S. EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The emission of PM2.5 can be reduced by 99% and 95% for natural gas and electricity switch. Toxic equivalent quantity value of PAHs was also decreased from 4.89 (coal) to 0.03 (natural gas) and 0.07 ‚àö√ò_g/MJnet (electricity). When comprehensively considering the upstream pollutants emissions from power plant, natural gas switching performed better than coal_‚àö√´¬¨√™fired electricity. Moreover, the government supported the clean heating replacement project with extensive financial subsidy for purchasing clean stoves and using clean energy within 3 years in rural areas. A relatively cheaper price on an energy basic of natural gas and electricity use can be obtained after this subsidy compared to coal."	7		120-131		China	39.35	112.18	Rural	0	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	2016	2017	1	Ongoing [at publication]	N	N	NA	N	Environmental			Emissions Within Homes [Improved]; Environmental Pollution [Improved]	Barriers				"Poor public perception, lacking of environmental awareness, and peer effect still limit dissemination of clean heating replacement in rural areas."

Here we show that nationally-representative surveys reporting only _‚àö√´‚àö√≠primary cooking fuel_‚àö√´¬¨√π use may underestimate solid fuel use as a supplemental household cooking energy, particularly in rural areas where fuel availability issues play a stronger role in decisions about what fuels to use."	46		111-122	Liquefied petroleum gas; Induction stoves; National program; Energy transitions; Subsidies; Fuel stacking	Ecuador	0.6189774	-77.9489851	Rural	383	Y	Cookstoves	2014	2017	0.25	3	N	N		Y	NR 				Drivers and Barriers		"Wood-burning stoves offer the benefit through space heating, which is especially useful in cool, high-altitude areas.sample, woodfuel is widely used as a secondary cooking fuel to ration LPG and provide heating benefits, in addition to a desire to maintain traditional cooking practices."			 glass top of induction stove is perceived to be easier to clean than the tops of LPG stoves; induction stoves can be used if no LPG is available.

Nontraditional cookstove technologies can be efficacious in reducing this adverse impact, but they are adopted and used at puzzlingly low rates. This study analyzes the determinants of low demand for nontraditional cookstoves in rural Bangladesh by using both stated preference (from a nationally representative survey of rural women) and revealed preference (assessed by conducting a cluster-randomized trial of cookstove prices) approaches. We find consistent evidence across both analyses suggesting that the women in rural Bangladesh do not perceive indoor air pollution as a significant health hazard, prioritize other basic developmental needs over nontraditional cookstoves, and overwhelmingly rely on a free traditional cookstove technology and are therefore not willing to pay much for a new nontraditional cookstove. Efforts to improve health and abate environmental harm by promoting nontraditional cookstoves may be more successful by designing and disseminating nontraditional cookstoves with features valued more highly by users, such as reduction of operating costs, even when those features are not directly related to the cookstoves_‚Äö√Ñ√ª‚âàŒ© health and environmental impacts."	109	27	10815-10820		Bangladesh	23.82	90.41	Rural	2280	Y	Cookstoves	2008	2008	1	NR	N	N		Y	Social and Economic	Time Saving [Improved]	Cost Saving [Improved]		Drivers and Barriers			"The vast majority of respondents (94%) believe that indoor smoke is harmful and 69% correctly believe that indoor smoke is more harmful than dust from sweeping, the majority also believe that smoke is less harmful than polluted water (76%) and spoiled food (66%).

In many cases, households that ordered cookstoves declined to accept and pay for them at the time of delivery. Refusal rates were highly correlated with cookstove price, which may suggest that households face liquidity constraints, i.e., households could not take delivery because they did not have enough cash on hand to pay for the cookstove on the date of delivery. Indeed, the majority of households refusing to pay stated lack of cash as the primary reason. Liquidity constraints are likely a key determinant of a household‚àö√ßs decision to purchase: discounted prices (implying that households have to have less cash on hand) significantly reduce refusal rates for both efficiency and chimney cookstoves."							The next most-valued attributes are the ability to reduce cooking time (21%) and to accommodate a wider variety of biomass fuels (14%). Only 9% of respondents answered that reducing or eliminating household smoke is what they value most about nontraditional cookstoves.

We use social network analysis to reveal patterns driving a successful stove intervention in western Honduras. The intervention lacks formal marketing, but has spread across a wide area in just a few years. To understand the process, we map the social network of active community members who drove diffusion across a large swath of the country. We find that most ACMs heard about stoves twice before sharing information about it with others and introducing the stove into their own communities. On average, the social distance between ACMs and the project team is 3 degrees of separation. Both men and women are critical to the diffusion process, but men tend to communicate over longer distances, while women principally communicate over shorter distances. Government officials are also crucial to diffusion. Understanding how information moves through social networks and across geographic space allows us to theorize how knowledge about beneficial technologies spreads in the absence of formal marketing and inform policies for NTCS deployment worldwide."	66		379-389	Social networks; Non-traditional cookstoves; Diffusion of innovations	Honduras	14.916667	-88.233333	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	90	Y	Cookstoves	2008	2012	1	Ongoing at publication	N	Y	Y		NR 				Drivers			"After hearing about the LE2x3 (Cookstove) themselves, the majority of individuals in the network subsequently told three or more people about the stove."

Capital-cost subsidies that have been traditionally employed to enhance ICS adoption were augmented with rebates linked to stated and objectively measured use in order to investigate impacts on both initial and sustained adoption in the treatment group. Results show that households do respond to these rebates by adopting the intervention ICS at significantly higher rates, and by using it more frequently and for longer periods. Consistent with these stove-use patterns, solid-fuel use and time spent collecting or preparing fuels also decline. However, this effect appears to diminish over time. Thus, while economic inducements may significantly increase adoption and use of new environmental health technologies, corresponding reductions in environmental or livelihood burdens are not guaranteed.

The initiative has set itself the lofty aim of providing energy service comparable to clean sources such as LPG but using the same solid biomass fuels commonly used today. Such a clean energy option for the estimated 160 million Indian households now cooking with inefficient and polluting biomass and coal cookstoves could yield enormous gains in health and welfare for the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society. At the same time, cleaner household cooking energy through substitution by advanced-combustion biomass stoves (or other options such as clean fuels) can nearly eliminate the several important products of incomplete combustion that come from today's practices and are important outdoor and greenhouse pollutants. Using national surveys, published literature and assessments, and measurements of cookstove performance solely from India, we find that about 570,000 premature deaths in poor women and children and over 4% of India's estimated greenhouse emissions could be avoided if such an initiative were in place today. These avoided emissions currently would be worth more than US$1 billion on the international carbon market. In addition, about one-third of India's black carbon emissions can be reduced along with a range of other health- and climate-active pollutants that affect regional air quality and climate. Although current advanced biomass stoves show substantial emissions reductions over traditional stoves, there is still additional improvement needed to reach LPG-like emission levels. We recognize that the technology development and deployment challenges to meet NCI goals of this scale are formidable and a forthcoming companion paper focuses on what program design elements might best be able to overcome these challenges."	14	2	63-72		India			Not Reported	0	Y	Cookstoves					N				NR 				Neither

However, a new class of advanced cookstoves equipped with thermoelectric generators could improve both emissions performance and adoption leading to better health outcomes. These cookstoves use electrical power provided by a thermoelectric generator to power combustion-improving fans while powering outboard USB charging ports. In communities lacking electricity access, USB levels of power could provide much-needed off-grid charging for mobile phones, small lights, and other loads. However, there is a risk that instead of being used primarily as a cooking tool, these cookstoves could be used solely as fire-powered USB chargers. Without displacing traditional cookstoves, _‚àö√´‚àö√≠charging-only_‚àö√´¬¨√π adoption would result in a net increase in emissions exposure. In this study, we used custom Advanced Stove Use Monitor (ASUM) sensors to measure adoption of TEG-equipped cookstoves in 72 rural homes without electricity access in Odisha, India. To measure the impacts of the USB charging port, we randomized whether recipients received a cookstove with USB ports enabled or disabled. We found that access to USB charging ports significant increased adoption of cookstoves in _‚àö√´‚àö√≠cooking_‚àö√´¬¨√π use modes; USB-enabled cookstoves were used for cooking 3.5X more than identical cookstoves with disabled USB ports. This substantial increase in cooking came with a relatively small marginal use of the cookstove in a _‚àö√´‚àö√≠charging-only_‚àö√´¬¨√π mode; just 11% of total cookstove use was in this mode. As with past work, data showed that surveys of user behavior do not correlate well with sensor-measured behavior. The trial cookstove was much smaller and more cumbersome than traditional cookstoves, but still, we found that users were willing to prepare fuel and found the cookstove useful for light cooking tasks. Access to USB charging served as a catalyst for adoption of advanced cookstoves as cooking tools and did not increase undesirable _‚àö√´‚àö√≠charging only_‚àö√´¬¨√π adoption modes.

A questionnaire was administered to 1200 households on stove use and cooking behaviours including previously defined factors associated with clean cookstove adoption. Logistic multivariable regressions with 16 pre-specified explanatory variables were performed for three outcomes; (1) daily improved solid fuel stove use, (2) use of liquefied petroleum gas stove and (3) traditional stove displacement.

Most of the rural households of North-Eastern India rely heavily upon fuelwood and traditional open-fire cookstoves for cooking activities. And everyday collection of fuelwood is time-consuming. Hence, women often gather fuelwood to make charcoal. While the use of charcoal has some advantages, it is not clear whether the investment of time in making charcoal is worthwhile. In this paper, we compare household time investments for fuelwood and charcoal production. The study is done using survey data on Napaam village situated in Sonitpur District of Assam, Northeast India. We developed a model to analyse fuelwood needed and time spent upon the introduction of improved cookstoves and/or charcoal production. This analysis reveals that improved cookstoves using fuelwood results in the least time expenditure on the production of cooking fuel. Whilst introducing charcoal marginally reduces the amount of fuelwood, but increases time spent on cooking, due to the time required to produce the charcoal. Hence, rural households who make their own charcoal spend more time on producing cooking fuel than those households relying on direct use of fuelwood."	151		309-316	Fuelwood; Charcoal; Cookstove; Rural area; Time efficiency	India	26.70458	92.82304	Rural	178	Y	Cookstoves					N				NR 				Neither

We test this hypothesis in the context of efficient cooking technology in India. We use stated preference methods to first characterize household tastes for various features of a more efficient cooking technology. We then relate these typically unobserved preferences to households¬¨√™ adoption decisions during an experiment that allowed them to choose between two alternatives with different features. Stated preferences help predict actual adoption: households initially classified as uninterested are less likely to purchase and use any new technology, while relative distaste for pollution is linked to selection of a cleaner technology. Because of this influence on adoption behaviors, preference heterogeneity has important implications for how environmental policies can impact various health and development outcomes."	0			Discrete choice experiment; latent class analysis; field experiment; India	India	29.39	79.45	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	987	Y	Cookstoves	2012	2012	0.2		N				Social and Economic	Choice [Improved]	Willingness to Pay [Improved]		Drivers and Barriers					"Two (of three) classes of respondents - 12% and 23% of the sample- appeared to be ‚àö√òinterested‚àö√ß in the features of cleaner technology; Class 1 people placed greater weight on smoke emissions reductions.

The availability of wood is decreasing and deforestation is a major ecological problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. The scarcity of wood is demanding for a sustainable solution. The sun seems to provide a good alternative. Solar energy is free, without unhealthy smoke or chances to burns. The idea of using solar energy for cooking is not new: many different techniques have already been tested. Most variants are expensive, and therefore not available for most families in Sub-Saharan Africa. A cheap solar cooking device is the CooKit, a cardboard panel cooker covered with aluminium foil. In the adaptation to the CooKit, as to all innovations, it is important that the users are convinced of the advantages. An important step in the adaptation process is learning how to use the cooking device; the best way to do this is by home practice. Monitoring and evaluating the real use is needed, for it is interesting to know if the CooKit is actually used, and also to find out how women have implemented the new technique in their kitchens. In 2005, the SUPO foundation started a project in Burkina Faso: Programme Energie Solaire Grand-Ouaga (PESGO). The aim of PESGO is to introduce the CooKit in the urban households in Ouagadougou by providing training sessions and home assistance. In this paper, a mid-term review on this small-scale cooking project is presented. The possibilities and challenges of solar cooking are outlined, taking the urban context of Ouagadougou in account. In PESGO, dependence on weather conditions is found to be one of the challenges: if sunrays are blocked by clouds or dust in the air, the cooking will be slowed down. The CooKit cannot replace firewood entirely, and a complementary element has to be found. SUPO is exploring the use of Jatropha oil as a complement to the CooKit. The Jatropha plant is drought tolerant and its fruits contain oil which can be used as fuel substitute. Further research on its use is interesting, because the combination of the CooKit and Jatropha oil seems to have high potential in the kitchens of West-Africa."	34	1	65-71	Sustainable energy; Solar cooking; CooKit; Jatropha; Urban area; Burkina Faso	Burkina Faso	12.38	-1.52	Urban	97	Y	Cookstoves	2005	2005	2	NR	N	N		N	Social 	Education [Improved]; Time Saving [Improved]			Drivers and Barriers						"Dependence on weather conditions was the main pitfall of the CooKit. The capacity of the CooKit, which is not large enough for larger families"													"One of the positive remarks made by the participants was the aspect of time saving. The CooKit can be left in the sun without close attention; it only needs to be turned towards the sun once every 30 min. And while the sun is doing the cooking work, women could spend time on other activities."	"Existing gender patterns (i.e. absence of men Fig. 3. Jatropha Curcas (Egypt). 70 H.M. Toonen / Physics and Chemistry of the Earth 34 (2009) 65_71 during lunch, women‚àö√ßs responsibility for cooking) have also an impact on the actual use of the CooKit in day-to-day life. Men are important decision makers in putting the solar energy into use, for they are often in charge of financial decisions within the household."

To tackle this problem, in 2012, the Peruvian Government created the FISE program, which subsidizes the replacement of traditional stoves with gas cookstoves. This paper describes the challenges faced during the implementation of the FISE, such as the selection of beneficiaries and the creation of a national network of suppliers for the delivery of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders. Using a dataset with information collected from five districts in the department of Ayacucho in 2015, we apply propensity score matching at the household level to evaluate the effects of the program. We show that the FISE favored the adoption of the LPG cookstoves, but that many households still combine their use with traditional cookstoves. We find no evidence that the use of LPG stoves has reduced respiratory problems in the beneficiary households; however, the program has been found to increase the use of LPG stoves for boiling water, which may reduce the exposition of child in beneficiary households to water-related diseases."	118		559-572	Cookstoves; LPG; Subsidies; Indoor air pollution; Health; FISE program; Peru	Peru	-13.16	-74.22	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	1816	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	2012	2015	5	NR	N	NR		Y	Social and Economic and Environmental	Human Health and Wellbeing [Improved]	Sustained Funding [Improved]; Supply Chain [Worsened]	Emissions Within Homes [Improved]	Drivers	"The program encourages the replacement of traditional or/and improved stoves with LPG stoves, promotes the use of LPG stoves for cooking, even in those households that were already using an LPG stove before the implementation of the program."

Conventional energy transition models emphasize households' socio-economic improvement as the most important driver of energy transition. However, previous work has shown households' continued use of old cookstoves or fuels even when adopting new technologies. Through a case study in India, this paper highlights the socio-political processes of the permanent removal of the traditional chulha cookstove. Newly available liquefied petroleum gas stoves and improved biomass stoves, thought to be substitutes for chulha, lead to different adoption pathways for lower and higher caste households. Lower caste households seem to remove chulha more readily because of sensitivity to chulha's heavy smoke that pollutes their utensils, kitchen, and clothes. We posit that by adopting cleaner stoves and removing traditional ones, the marginalized can disassociate themselves from practices that perpetuate their social stigma."	27		127-136	Cookstoves; Diffusion; Displacement; Energy access; LPG; India	India	31.96	77.1	Rural	200	Y	Energy - Other	2013				N				NR 				Neither

To this end, Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and Error Correction Model (ECM) have been estimated to quantify the short-run and long-run price and the income elasticity of various energy products. The results show that the price elasticity of demand for all fossil fuels is low, but the respective income elasticity is higher. Therefore, an increase in the general price level caused by the subsidy reform will lead to the erosion of real income and will have related welfare implications in India. The results also reveal that energy expenditure will obviously increase and hence energy consumption will decline depending upon the extent of the withdrawal of subsidy. Therefore, policy makers in India, while undertaking further reforms, must ensure that the subsidy reaches to those who truly deserve, so that the socioeconomic casualty of reforms can be minimized along with achieving fiscal goals"	102		453-462	Energy subsidy; Elasticity; Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model; Error Correction Model (ECM)	India	28.53	77.07	Not Reported	0	N	Energy - Other	1970	NR	NR	NA	N	Y	N	Y	Economic		Income [Worsened]; Fuel Use [Worsened]		Neither

Energy Policy		https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.005		"A majority of grid-connected households in South Africa use electricity for cooking and heating tasks. This thermal intensive use of electricity has a high load factor and is a contributory factor of electricity demand outstripping supply at peak demand periods. The government has promoted liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as an alternative thermal energy source for household cooking and heating. This study evaluates the long-term successes, challenges and social impacts of an LPG intervention project that was piloted in Atteridgeville Township, a typical low-income suburb. The data was gathered through one-on-one household interviews with a sample of the beneficiaries. The results indicate that seven years after the LPG intervention, about 70% of the beneficiaries continue to use LPG and report that the intervention has improved their welfare. Fast cooking is cited as the key tangible benefit of LPG technology in households, followed by saving on electricity bills. The project would have achieved more success through better community engagement, including strict beneficiary selection criteria; a long-term LPG distribution and maintenance plan; and inclusion of recurring monthly LPG subsidies for indigent households. The study discusses the subset of factors necessary for successful rollouts of similar energy projects."	93		150-156	Energy access; Electricity load; LPG; Energy delivery model; Cookstoves; Subsidies	South Africa	-25.78	27.99	Urban	200	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	2006	2013	0.2	7	N	N			NR 				Drivers and Barriers			"Energy expense, Time saving, and Prestige and status all either improved somewhat or improved greatly (Table 4)"				Respondents indicate that durability is the most important attribute that they consider when shopping for a household energy technology (55%) (table 5)					Distribution collapsed after 4 months	Government policy options on whether to 'subsidise the purchase of household energy equipment' only or to 'provide monthly fuel subsidies' only are strongly supported in almost equal measure by over 60% of the respondents.

An evaluation of the Fondo de Inclusion Social Energ_tico program to promote access to liquefied petroleum gas in Peru.	Energy for Sustainable Development		https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2018.06.001		"Introduction - Over 80% of rural households in Peru use solid fuels as their primary source of domestic energy, which contributes to several health problems. In 2016, 6.7 million Peruvians were living in rural areas. The Fondo de Inclusion Social Energ_tico (FISE) LPG Promotion Program, which began in 2012 and is housed under the Ministry of Energy and Mining, is a government-sponsored initiative aimed at reducing use of solid fuels by increasing access to clean fuel for cooking to poor Peruvian households. Methods- We conducted a mixed methods study incorporating data from publicly available records and reports, a community survey of 375 households in Puno (the province with the largest number of FISE beneficiary households), and in-depth interviews with community members and key stakeholders. We used the Reach, Effectiveness _ Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to guide our data collection and analysis efforts. In a sample of 95 households, we also measured 48-hour area concentrations and personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Results - The FISE LPG promotion program has achieved high geographical reach; the program is currently serving households in 100% of districts in Peru. Households with access to electricity may be participating at a higher level than households without electricity because the program is implemented primarily by electricity distributors. In a sample of 95 households, FISE beneficiaries experienced a reduction in kitchen concentrations of PM2.5; however, there were no differences in personal exposures, and both kitchen and personal exposures were above the WHO intermediate target for indoor air quality. Among the 375 households surveyed, stove stacking with biomass fuels was reported in >95% of both beneficiary and non-beneficiary households, with fewer than 5% reporting exclusive use. In-depth interviews suggest that the complexity of the enrollment process and access to LPG distribution points may be key barriers to participating in FISE. Conclusion - The FISE LPG Program has achieved high reach and its targeted subsidy and surcharge-based financing structure represent a potentially feasible and sustainable model for other government programs. However, the prevalence of stove stacking among FISE beneficiaries remains high. There is a need for improved communication channels between program implementers and beneficiaries. FISE should also consider expanding the mobile LPG network and community delivery service to reduce physical barriers and indirect costs of LPG acquisition. Finally, increasing the value of LPG vouchers to completely cover one or two tanks a month, or alternatively, introducing behavior change strategies to reduce monthly LPG usage, may facilitate the transition to exclusive LPG use."	46		82-93	LPG; Biomass fuels; RE-AIM; Program evaluation; Clean cooking; Adoption	Peru	-15.85	-70.05	Rural	375	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	2012	2015	2	3	N	Y	N	Y	Social 	Human Health and Wellbeing [Improved]			Drivers and Barriers				"People expressed that food tastes better when cooked with baseline technology, limiting desire to participate in program and use LPG.

However, low adoption and use of these stoves in many settings has limited their benefits. We aimed to improve the understanding of improved stove use by describing the patterns and predictors of adoption of a semi-gasifier stove and processed biomass fuel intervention in southwestern China. Of 113 intervention homes interviewed, 79% of homes tried the stove, and the majority of these (92%) continued using it 5_10 months later. One to five months after intervention, the average proportion of days that the semi-gasifier stove was in use was modest (40.4% [95% CI 34.3_46.6]), and further declined over 13 months. Homes that received the stove in the first batch used it more frequently (67.2% [95% CI 42.1_92.3] days in use) than homes that received it in the second batch (29.3% [95% CI 13.8_44.5] days in use), likely because of stove quality and user training. Household stove use was positively associated with reported cooking needs and negatively associated with age of the main cook, household socioeconomic status, and the availability of substitute cleaner-burning stoves.

"The National Biodigester Program (NBP) was established in 2006 to build and maintain household biodigesters in Cambodia. In its first six years, the program installed almost 20,000 biodigesters and established an in-country network of local financiers, construction companies, skilled masons, bioslurry specialists and after-care technicians accessible to rural users in 14 of 24 Cambodian provinces. Since its initial success, the program's adoption rates have stalled despite increasing government support and high rates of user satisfaction. Building on an initial evaluation of the NBP in 2013, this updated assessment identifies multiple changes in its second implementation phase that have undermined the initial momentum of the program. Abrupt interruptions in institutional support, deteriorating supply side services (access to construction agents, masons, repair services) and reduced access to credit for farmers have eroded the service network that the first implementation phase established. Structural changes in the rural economy may also contribute to declining demand. Government support to another biodigester program which offers a lower investment price, but does not provide after-sales services, has also undercut the long-term implementation strategy of the NBP. The paper finds that despite these programmatic changes, the installed biodigesters continue to perform according to expectation and to be maintained and valued by their users, but the future viability of the program remains uncertain."	46		Nov-22	Keywords: Biodigesters; RE-AIM framework; Carbon finance; Energy subsidies	Cambodia	11.5793306	104.750101	Rural	62	N	Energy - Other	2006	2017	0.1	11	Y	Y	N	Y	NR 				Drivers and Barriers		"labor migration, reduced numbers of livestock, and electrification as factors undermining demand for the Farmer's Friend."	training and deploying national skills and entrepreneurialism to support adoption of biogas stoves.

However, the change in mortality risk associated with such a transition remains unclear. Methods- The China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) Study enrolled participants (aged 30_79 years) from ten areas across China; we chose to study participants from five urban areas where transition from use of solid fuels to clean fuels for cooking was prevalent. Participants who reported regular cooking (weekly or more frequently) at baseline were categorised as persistent clean fuel users, previous solid fuel users, or persistent solid fuel users, according to selfreported fuel use histories. All-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality were identified through linkage to China¬¨√™s Disease Surveillance Point system and local mortality records. Findings-  Between June 24, 2004, and July 15, 2008, 226186 participants living in five urban areas of China were enrolled in the CKB Study. Among 171677 participants who reported cooking regularly (weekly or more frequently), 75785 (44%) were persistent clean fuel users, 80511 (47%) were previous solid fuel users, and 15381 (9%) were persistent solid fuel users. During a mean of 9‚àö‚àÇ8 (SD 1‚àö‚àÇ7) years of follow-up, 10831 deaths were documented, including 3819 cardiovascular deaths and 761 respiratory deaths. Compared with persistent clean fuel users, persistent solid fuel users had significantly higher risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1‚àö‚àÇ19, 95% CI 1‚àö‚àÇ10_1‚àö‚àÇ28), cardiovascular mortality (1‚àö‚àÇ24, 1‚àö‚àÇ10_1‚àö‚àÇ39), and respiratory mortality (1‚àö‚àÇ43, 1‚àö‚àÇ10_1‚àö‚àÇ85). The excess risk of all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality fell by more than 60% in 5 years after cessation of solid fuel use and continued to decrease afterwards. Use of ventilation was associated with lower all-cause mortality risk, even among persistent clean fuel users (HR 0‚àö‚àÇ78, 0‚àö‚àÇ69_0‚àö‚àÇ89). Interpretation-  Solid fuel use for cooking is associated with a higher risk of mortality, and cessation of solid fuel use cuts excess mortality risks swiftly and substantially within 5 years.

Compared with persistent clean fuel users, persistent solid fuel users had significantly higher risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1‚àö‚àÇ19, 95% CI 1‚àö‚àÇ10_1‚àö‚àÇ28), cardiovascular mortality (1‚àö‚àÇ24, 1‚àö‚àÇ10_1‚àö‚àÇ39), and respiratory mortality (1‚àö‚àÇ43, 1‚àö‚àÇ10_1‚àö‚àÇ85). The excess risk of all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality fell by more than 60% in 5 years after cessation of solid fuel use and continued to decrease afterwards. Use of ventilation was associated with lower all-cause mortality risk, even among persistent clean fuel users (HR 0‚àö‚àÇ78, 0‚àö‚àÇ69_0‚àö‚àÇ89). Interpretation-  Solid fuel use for cooking is associated with a higher risk of mortality, and cessation of solid fuel use cuts excess mortality risks swiftly and substantially within 5 years. Ventilation use also lowers the risk of mortality, even among people who persistently use clean fuels. It is of prime importance for both policy makers and the public to accelerate the transition from solid fuels to clean fuels and promote efficient ventilation to minimise further adverse health effects."

Cooking fuels and risk of all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality in urban China: a prospective cohort study	Lancet Global Health		https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(19)30525-X		"Background- Cooking practice has transitioned from use of solid fuels to use of clean fuels, with addition of better ventilation facilities. However, the change in mortality risk associated with such a transition remains unclear. Methods- The China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) Study enrolled participants (aged 30_79 years) from ten areas across China; we chose to study participants from five urban areas where transition from use of solid fuels to clean fuels for cooking was prevalent. Participants who reported regular cooking (weekly or more frequently) at baseline were categorised as persistent clean fuel users, previous solid fuel users, or persistent solid fuel users, according to selfreported fuel use histories. All-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality were identified through linkage to China¬¨√™s Disease Surveillance Point system and local mortality records. Findings-  Between June 24, 2004, and July 15, 2008, 226186 participants living in five urban areas of China were enrolled in the CKB Study. Among 171677 participants who reported cooking regularly (weekly or more frequently), 75785 (44%) were persistent clean fuel users, 80511 (47%) were previous solid fuel users, and 15381 (9%) were persistent solid fuel users.

In Nicaragua the feasibility of attacking this problem was studied at one of its roots, the demand for and consumption of firewood, through a massive fuel switch towards kerosene. A locally-based foundation distributed 700 high-quality Chinese kerosene stoves, using a credit scheme, both in a village and in a suburb of the capital. Surveys of family fuel consumption for meal preparation were carried out before the intervention and again, one year later, after the intervention. The population's acceptance of the stoves was very high. Proof of this is evident in such factors as (1) the high percentage of delivery of the stoves to 93% and 73%, respectively, of the population that uses firewood or charcoal; (2) the highly enthusiastic reactions elicited from the people during visits by the Foundation's workers; (3) the high usage rate of the stoves (80%); and (4) the overall decrease of 50% in the use of firewood for the involved area. This article is centered around the extent of coverage, social acceptance and community behavior, and the local capacity to perform this fuel switch, while themes related to energy efficiency, energy policy, the greenhouse effect and financial implications are incorporated to indicate the national and international impact of this strategy. Offering an alternative source of fuel to the population is a feasible, cheap and highly appreciated solution to deforestation. Projects using these methods could potentially lower firewood consumption at the national level by 50%. Local organizations are capable of implementing this strategy on a wide scale. The economically less favored classes of the population can be reached without any major constraints, leading at the same time to important positive effects on health. The cost per tonne of carbon emission avoided through this strategy is calculated at US$ 1.7, which is far below standards used in joint implementation programs. A worldwide strategy could lower the present surplus balance of CO2 emission by 13%, maintaining at the same time the natural capacity of CO2 absorption. In this scenario, the world consumption of petroleum products will increase by 0.8%."	3	5	26-39		Nicaragua	12.07	-86.49	Rural	418	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	1995	1995	1	1	N	Y	Y	N	Economic and Environmental		Cost Saving [No Change]; Fuel Use [Improved]	Deforestation [Improved]	Barriers								"Relatively strong backward fuel switch (from gas to kerosene) observed, which is related to cash-flow situation of families, as kerosene can be bought in small quantities"

Surveys of family fuel consumption for meal preparation were carried out before the intervention and again, one year later, after the intervention. The population's acceptance of the stoves was very high. Proof of this is evident in such factors as (1) the high percentage of delivery of the stoves to 93% and 73%, respectively, of the population that uses firewood or charcoal; (2) the highly enthusiastic reactions elicited from the people during visits by the Foundation's workers; (3) the high usage rate of the stoves (80%); and (4) the overall decrease of 50% in the use of firewood for the involved area. This article is centered around the extent of coverage, social acceptance and community behavior, and the local capacity to perform this fuel switch, while themes related to energy efficiency, energy policy, the greenhouse effect and financial implications are incorporated to indicate the national and international impact of this strategy. Offering an alternative source of fuel to the population is a feasible, cheap and highly appreciated solution to deforestation. Projects using these methods could potentially lower firewood consumption at the national level by 50%. Local organizations are capable of implementing this strategy on a wide scale. The economically less favored classes of the population can be reached without any major constraints, leading at the same time to important positive effects on health. The cost per tonne of carbon emission avoided through this strategy is calculated at US$ 1.7, which is far below standards used in joint implementation programs. A worldwide strategy could lower the present surplus balance of CO2 emission by 13%, maintaining at the same time the natural capacity of CO2 absorption. In this scenario, the world consumption of petroleum products will increase by 0.8%."	3	5	26-39		Nicaragua	12.13	-86.03	Urban	545	Y	Energy - Fuel Transition	1995	1995	1	1	N	Y	Y	N	Economic and Environmental		Cost Saving [Improved]; Fuel Use [Improved]	Deforestation [Improved]	Barriers								"Relatively strong backward fuel switch (from gas to kerosene) observed, which is related to cash-flow situation of families, as kerosene can be bought in small quantities"

Providing cleaner energy access in Indonesia through the megaproject of kerosene conversion to LPG	Energy Policy	0301-4215	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.02.061	http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511001534	"In 2007 Indonesia undertook a massive energy program to convert its primary cooking fuel from kerosene to LPG in more than 50 million households. This megaproject, to be completed in late 2011, provided an improved household cooking fuel, with its associated benefits in user costs, cleanliness, convenience, and environment, and reduced the government's huge subsidy for petroleum fuels. Presented from the perspective of Pertamina, Indonesia's sole NOC, and the program implementer, this paper describes the background of the fuels situation, the planning stages, including the preparatory analytical work, targeted market surveys and tests, and the subsequent building of the financial, technical, and institutional models for carrying out the program on an expeditious schedule. It presents the project's major execution steps, results of the program to date, and the unique institutional roles of each party, including the activities and benefits for the government, Pertamina, the public, the industry, and the crucial agents in the fuel supply chains. Finally there is a retrospective policy analysis and a discussion of key factors and challenges in the execution of Indonesia's largest-ever energy initiative to provide improved cooking fuel."	39	12	7575-7586	Cooking fuels; LPG; Fuel switching	Indonesia	-6.208657	106.848047	Urban Peri-Urban and Rural	44000000	Y	Cookstoves	2006	2007	3	0	Y	Y	N		NR 				Neither

Through a qualitative research methodology this study documented the adoption of a new technology, by following an improved cookstove implementation program carried out by a Mexican NGO. This technology reduces fuel consumption and addresses health impacts of indoor air pollution caused by the widespread use of traditional biomass fuels in open fires in developing countries. Different demographic and socio-economic factors have been analyzed to explain the low success rates implementation projects have faced worldwide, but there are almost no studies that examine the problem from the perspective of implementers. The aim of this study was to understand how the different visions of the individuals involved in an implementation program affect its outcome. Findings showed that the NGO work was constrained by the need to meet the commitment with sponsors. The adoption rates did not change between the first and the second stage of the project, even though the approach towards users was very different.

Inefficient use of fuel wood is considered one of the important causes of deforestation. Use of more efficient improved cookstoves is proposed as one of the measures that can reduce demand for fuel wood and charcoal and help in lowering the annoying deforestation rate in many developing countries. During the 1980s and 1990s several programs aiming at testing and disseminating energy saving technologies were implemented in Sudan. One of these technologies was improved cookstoves, which was intended to increase the efficiency of using energy from biomass sources. This study is carried out to examine the adoption rate and the factors affecting adoption of improved cookstoves in Khartoum State. The study is based on primary data collected through personal interviews with husbands and wives in 300 randomly selected households. Regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The results showed that the device's adoption rate was very low. The improved cookstove's relative advantage, housewife's exposure to messages about improved cookstoves, educational level of the housewife and the average educational level of the female household's members had significant positive effect on the household's innovativeness regarding adoption of improved cookstove. Wife's age and the educational level of the husband had negative significant effects. In the Sudanese patriarchal society all the household domestic tasks, particularly food preparation and related activities, are considered women's responsibilities and all the decisions related to them are taken by women. Therefore, these results could be understood as a reflection of the division of labor, gender relations and decision-making process in the Sudanese household."	307	01-Mar	259-266		Sudan	15.64	32.49	Urban and Rural	300	Y	Cookstoves	1984	1984	15	NR	N	N		Y	NR 				Neither

BMC Public Health			https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2458-12-359	"Background: Exposure to household air pollutants released during cooking has been linked to numerous adverse health outcomes among residents of rural areas in low-income countries. Improved cookstoves are one of few available interventions, but achieving equity in cookstove access has been challenging. Therefore, innovative approaches are needed. To evaluate a project designed to motivate adoption of locally-produced, ceramic cookstoves (upesi jiko) in an impoverished, rural African population, we assessed the perceived benefits of the cookstoves (in monetary and time-savings terms), the rate of cookstove adoption, and the equity of adoption. Methods: The project was conducted in 60 rural Kenyan villages in 2008 and 2009. Baseline (n = 1250) and follow-up (n = 293) surveys and a stove-tracking database were analyzed. Results: At baseline, nearly all respondents used wood (95%) and firepits (99%) for cooking; 98% desired smoke reductions. Households with upesi jiko subsequently spent <100 Kenyan Shillings/week on firewood more often (40%) than households without upesi jiko (20%) (p = 0.0002). There were no significant differences in the presence of children <2 years of age in households using upesi jiko (48%) or three-stone stoves (49%) (p = 0.88); children 2_5 years of age were less common in households using upesi jiko versus three-stone stoves (46% and 69%, respectively) (p = 0.0001). Vendors installed 1,124 upesi jiko in 757 multi-family households in 18 months; 68% of these transactions involved incentives for vendors and purchasers. Relatively few (<10%) upesi jiko were installed in households of women in the youngest age quartile (<22 years) or among households in the poorest quintile. Conclusions: Our strategy of training of local vendors, appropriate incentives, and product integration effectively accelerated cookstove adoption into a large number of households. The strategy also created opportunities to reinforce health messages and promote cookstoves sales and installation. However, the project‚àö√ßs overall success was diminished by inequitable and incomplete adoption by households with the lowest socioeconomic status and young children present. Additional evaluations of similar strategies will be needed to determine whether our strategy can be applied equitably elsewhere, and whether reductions in fuel use, household air pollution, and the incidence of respiratory diseases will follow adoption of improved cookstoves."	12	1	359		Kenya	-0.09	34.76	Rural	1500	Y	Cookstoves	2007	2008	3	1	N	Y	Y	N	NR 				Neither

This program is rooted in the current effort to change Ecuador's energy balance, with hydroelectric power expected to generate 83.61% of national electricity by 2022, ending the need for subsidized LPG. For this analysis, the 2014 baseline situation has been compared with two future scenarios for 2022: a business-as-usual scenario and an NECP-success scenario. This study demonstrates the viability of migration from imported fossil fuels to locally-produced renewable energy as the basis for an efficient cooking facility. The new policies scenario would save US$ 1.162 billion in annual government expenditure on cooking subsidies, and reducing CO2 emissions associated to energy for cooking in 1.8 tCO2/y."	107		182-187	Household cooking; Induction stove; Technological migration	Ecuador	-0.16	-78.48	Urban and Rural	NR	Y	Energy - Other					N				NR

Electricity generation capacity has increased from a total of 30MW in 1991 to over 130MW at present. The lengths of transmission and distribution lines have similarly increased from 150km to 400km and from 800 to 1300km respectively. However, as in most Sub-Saharan Africa, this public utility is characterised by inefficient managerial, technical and financial performances, an inability to mobilize the funds needed for expansion, low repair and maintenance capacity, inappropriate tariff rates, and inadequate revenue collection mechanisms. This has led the government to take appropriate reform measures in recent years, including the restructuring of the Eritrea Electric Corporation (EEC) to operate on commercial principles, setting tariffs based on real costs and reasonable profits, effective collection of revenues, the minimization of wastage and loss in the delivery of energy services, facilitating the private sector participation, and ring-fencing the interests of the poor by setting up a Rural Electrification Fund. A Regulatory body has been established to enforce these reform measures. Recognising the role of modern energy in poverty reduction and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Government with the support of its development partners is expanding energy services to rural areas in an innovative manner. The Government's commitment to diversify energy sources is exemplified by its agreement with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to share the costs of an on-going pilot wind energy project. It has also established an Energy Research and Training Centre to promote the application of renewable energies and improved biomass stoves throughout Eritrea."	15	2	178-189	Eritrea; Electricity sector reform; Poverty reduction	Eritrea	15.79	38.45				Energy - Other					Y				NR

Adoption of liquefied petroleum gas stoves in Guatemala: A mixed-methods study	EcoHealth		doi:10.1007/s10393-018-1368-8.		"Household air pollution (HAP) is the sixth leading risk factor for premature mortality in Guatemala. Households in Guatemala are gradually adopting liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves, but a strong tradition of woodstove use persists. We conducted a mixed-methods study of LPG stove use in peri-urban Guatemala. We used Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices surveys with 187 LPG stove owners who also used woodstoves to identify perceptions of stove and cooking practices. Barriers to sustained use of LPG stoves were evaluated through focus groups, participant observations with stove users, and key informant interviews with community leaders. Seven themes emerged that explain household decisions to use LPG stoves: (1) the ‚Äúnew technology‚Äù should be framed in terms of what the ‚Äúold technology‚Äù lacks, (2) income is not a predictor of gas stove acquisition but may predict sustained use, (3) men are key decision-makers but messages about LPG do not target them, (4) when stoves are viewed as ‚Äúprize possessions‚Äù they may not be used, (5) collective fear about gas stoves is not based on personal experience, but on ‚Äústories we hear‚Äù, (6) sustained LPG use is hampered by two major factors, seasonally available wood and LPG retailers who are perceived as dishonest, and (7) wood fuel collection is a time to enjoy the company of friends and family and is not ‚Äúdrudgery‚Äù. National policies should promote the use of clean cookstove technologies in peri-urban and rapidly urbanizing areas in Guatemala where LPG stoves are in use, but used intermittently, instead of the current plan to install 100,000 ‚Äúimproved‚Äù woodstoves by 2032. This could be done by improving dependable cylinder distribution services, targeting gas safety and promoting positive health messages that appeal to men, as well as women."	15	4	745-756	"household air pollution; liquefied petroleum gas; Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices surveys; Guatemala; mixed-methods"	Guatemala	15.79	-90.23	Peri-Urban			Cookstoves

Household Determinants of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) as a Cooking Fuel in SW Cameroon	EcoHealth		https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-018-1378-6		"Currently 70% of the population in Cameroon are reliant on solid fuel for cooking (90% in rural communities) and the associated household air pollution contributes to significant mortality and morbidity in the country. To address the problems of energy security, deforestation and pollution the government has developed a strategy (Masterplan) to increase use of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as a cooking fuel from 12% to 58% by 2030. As a clean fuel scaled adoption of LPG has the potential to make significant positive impacts on population health. The LPG Adoption in Cameroon Evaluation (LACE) studies are assessing in the community (i) barriers and enablers for and (ii) local interventions to support, adoption and sustained use of LPG. A census survey conducted for LACE in rural and peri-urban regions of SW Cameroon provided an opportunity to investigate current fuel use patterns and factors associated with primary and exclusive use of LPG. A cross-sectional survey of 1577 households (1334 peri-urban and 243 rural) was conducted in March 2016 using standardised fuel use and household socio-demographic questions, administered by trained fieldworkers. Wood (40.7%) and LPG (51.1%) were the most frequently reported fuels, although the dominant fuels in rural and peri-urban communities were wood (81%) and LPG (58%) respectively. Fuel stacking was observed for the majority of LPG using households (91% of peri-urban and 99% of rural households). In rural homes, a higher level of education, access to sanitation and piped water and household wealth (income and asset ownership) were all significantly associated with LPG use (p < 0.05). In peri-urban homes, younger age, access to sanitation and piped water and increasing education were significantly associated with both any and exclusive use of LPG (p < 0.05). However, whilst household wealth was related to any LPG use, there was no relationship with exclusive use. Results from this census survey of a relatively well-established LPG market with lower levels of poverty and high levels of education than Cameroon as a whole, find LPG usage well below target levels set by the Cameroon government (58% by 2030). Fuel stacking is an issue for the majority of LPG using households. Whilst, as observed here, education, household wealth and socio-economic status are well recognised predictors of adoption and sustained use of clean modern fuels, it is important to consider factors across the whole LPG eco-system when developing policies to support their scaled expansion. A comprehensive approach is therefore required to ensure implementation of the Cameroon LPG Masterplan achieves its aspirational adoption target within its stated timeframe."	15		729-743	"Household wealth, Socio-economic status, Clean fuel, Adoption, Household air pollution"	Cameroon	7.37	12.35	Peri-Urban and Rural			Energy - Fuel Transition

Adoption of biogas for household energy and factors affecting livelihood of the users in rural Bangladesh	"9th ASAE International Conference: Transformation in agricultural and food economy in Asia, 11-13 January 2017, Bangkok, Thailand. Proceedings"				"Domestic energy insecurity is a major threat to sustainable development in a developing country like Bangladesh. The present study aimed at estimating the factors that affect adoption of biogas plant and analysing the factors responsible for the improvement of livelihoods of the biogas users. The study was based on primary data collected from randomly chosen 50 biogas user households and 30 non users in Ghatail and Fulbaria upazilas (sub district) of Tangail and Mymensingh district respectively. Required data were collected adopting direct farm survey method during January to February, 2015. Binary logistic regression model was used to analyse the data. The findings of the study reveal that education, income, farm size, number of cattle and cost of fuel were positively associated with the adoption of biogas technology. The major findings of the logistic regression showed that respondents having education over 8 years had 20.78 times more possibility of adopting biogas technology than tthose who had education less than 8 years of schooling. The probability of adopting biogas plant by a household owning land above 0.60 hactare was 7.31 times higher than those households owning land less than 0.60 hactare. The results of the logistic regression model fitted for livelihood improvement revealed that a biogas user who supplied gas to other consumer is 11.66 times more likely to achieve moderate improvement in livelihood than the user who could not supply gas to other consumer. The findings also showed that environmental and econmic factors were the two vital factors influencing the adoption of biogas. This study highlighted on the strategies such as organizing training, publicity program, motivational activities on biogas technology; encourage more educated people to adopt biogas technology and expanding subsidy and loan provision, extending period of loan repayment to increase the likelihood of adopting biogas plants."			1642-1661	agricultural households; biogas; energy; environmental factors; livelihoods; rural areas; socioeconomics; technology transfer	Bangladesh	23.68	90.36	Rural			Energy - Fuel Transition

The per capita energy consumption in rural Pakistan is very low, especially in rural areas heavily relying on traditional energy sources. This paper presents the extent of biogas technology adoption by Pakistani rural households and the factors affecting their decision to adopt the technology in three selected districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The data were collected by interviewing 480 respondents by using a pretested and designed questionnaire. The results show that the household adoption rate of biogas technologies is low. The factors affecting the adoption decision of households included household income, access to credit, cultivated land area, the number of cattle in the household, education, and family size. The study also found fundamental barriers to the household adoption of biogas technologies, such as a lack of proper technical services by implementing organizations and insufficient governmental support. The authors make recommendations based on the findings to increase the adoption rate of biogas technologies in rural Pakistan. ¬¨¬© The Author(s) 2019."

A questionnaire was administered to 1200 households on stove use and cooking behaviours including previously defined factors associated with clean cookstove adoption. Logistic multivariable regressions with 16 pre-specified explanatory variables were performed for three outcomes; (1) daily improved solid fuel stove use, (2) use of liquefied petroleum gas stove and (3) traditional stove displacement. Eighty-seven percent of households reported daily improved solid fuel stove use, 51% liquefied petroleum gas stove use and 66% no longer used the traditional cookstove. Variables associated with one or more of the three outcomes are: education, age and civil status of the reporting female, household wealth and size, region, encounters of problems with the improved solid fuel stove, knowledge of somebody able to build an improved solid fuel stove, whether stove parts are obtainable in the community, and subsidy schemes. We conclude that to be successful, improved solid fuel stove programmes need to consider (1) existing household characteristics, (2) the household's need for ready access to maintenance and repair, and (3) improved knowledge at the community level."	14	7		"Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor/*prevention & control; *Cooking; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; *Household Articles; Humans; Middle Aged; Peru; Petroleum; Program Evaluation; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; *Peru; *adoption; *clean cookstoves; *household air pollution; *improved solid fuel stove; *liquefied petroleum gas; *stove stacking; the design of the study; in the collection, analyses, or interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript, and in the decision to publish the results."

It presents the case of an Indian village where nearly every house has successfully introduced a TV, but only one house adopted LPG for cooking. Considering that the former is more expensive than the latter and whilst both are relatively new and energy-related technologies, the paper asks how and why people decided to adopt one extensively but not the other. Methodologically, the study employs a mixed method approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings suggest that the lack of sufficient income has little influence on people to adopt or reject improved fuels. The paper argues that it may not give us a clear picture if we research why people choose or reject one fuel over another. This paper demonstrates that to understand a household's fuel choice decision, it is essential to understand the broader decision-making context within which families operate and make all decisions."	43		68-74	Energy transition; Cooking fuel; India; Household decisions	India	20.59	78.96	Rural			Energy - Fuel Transition
