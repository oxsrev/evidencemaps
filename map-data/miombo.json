    "Name": "How have carbon stocks in central and southern Africa’s miombo woodlands changed over the last 50 years? A systematic map of the evidence",
    "Description": "Miombo woodlands cover some 2.7 million square kilometres of central and southern Africa between dry (650 mm mean annual rainfall) and moist miombo (1,400 mm) and are currently threatened by land use and land cover changes that have intensified over the last 50 years.  Despite the miombo’s global significance for carbon (C) storage and sequestration, there has been no regional synthesis that maps carbon stocks and changes in the woodlands.  This information is crucial to inform further research for the development of appropriate policies and management strategies to maintain and increase C stocks and sequestration capacity, for conservation and sustainable management. This map displays the locations of studies, selected using a rigorous systematic methodology, that comprise the  evidence base for  changes in carbon stocks in miombo woodlands over the period 1960-2015; differences in carbon density in miombo with different conservation status; trends in carbon stock recovery following human disturbance; and  fire management impacts on carbon stocks and dynamics.
