Winter bird use of harvest residues in clearcuts and the implications of forest bioenergy harvest in the southeastern United States	Forest Ecology and Management		0378-1127	10.1016/j.foreco.2016.07.045	http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112716304017	"Increased market viability of harvest residues gleaned for forest bioenergy feedstocks may intensify downed wood removal, particularly in intensively managed forests of the Southeast. Downed wood provides food and cover for many wildlife species, including birds, yet we are aware of no study that has examined winter bird response to experimentally manipulated, operational-scale woody biomass harvests. Further, little research has investigated avian use of downed wood following timber harvests. As such, our objectives were to: (1) evaluate effects of varying intensities of woody biomass harvest on the winter bird community and (2) document spatial associations between winter bird species and available habitat structure, including downed wood, in regenerating stands. In January and February of 2012-2014, we surveyed birds using a modified version of spot-mapping in six woody biomass removal treatments in North Carolina, USA (n=4 regenerating stands). Treatments included clearcut harvest followed by: (1) traditional woody biomass harvest with no biomass harvesting guidelines; (2) 15% retention with harvest residues dispersed; (3) 15% retention with harvest residues clustered; (4) 30% retention with harvest residues dispersed; (5) 30% retention with harvest residues clustered; and (6) no woody biomass harvest (i.e., reference). We tested for treatment-level effects on avian relative abundance (overall and individual species), species diversity and richness, and counts of winter birds detected near (~1 m from pile), in, or on branches of downed wood piles and calculated proportional avian habitat use of harvest residues and vegetation in regenerating stands. In 69 visits over three winters, we observed 3352 birds in treatments. In 2013, counts of birds detected in piles were greater in the no biomass harvest and 30% clustered treatments than the no biomass harvesting guidelines treatment. In 2012 and 2013 combined, mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) had greater relative abundance in the no biomass harvest treatment compared to the 15% dispersed treatment and was more often detected within 1 m of downed wood piles than in vegetation. We counted more winter birds in and near adjacent forest edge than in treatment interiors each year. Overall, we detected minimal treatment effects on winter bird relative abundance and no effects on species diversity and richness. Relative abundance of winter birds increased over time as vegetative cover established in regenerating stands. Our results suggest woody biomass harvests in intensively managed pine forests had no effect on the winter bird community, but winter birds used harvest residues. Further, vegetation structure and composition, rather than availability of harvest residues, primarily influenced winter bird use of regenerating stands."	379		91-101		habitats; biodiversity; ecology; species diversity; guidelines; trees; woody plants; forests; renewable energy; vegetation; biomass; effects; coniferous forests; viability; regeneration; branches; wildlife; silvicultural systems; harvesting; bioenergy; clear felling; pines; residues; feedstocks; raw materials; plant residues	NC	35.6104	-76.8613	Conifer	Pinus taeda	39	Sawtimber	"All four blocks [70.5 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 6.1 (mean ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± SE) ha] were inten- sively managed forests planted with loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) seedlings and managed by Weyerhaeuser Company.

Terrestrial salamander assemblages were sampled before, immediately after, and one year after timber harvest on control and treatment plots to estimate abundance. We also surveyed salamanders immediately after the harvest along transects radiating out from cut plots to determine whether cutting triggered salamander emigration from disturbed plots. Both before and after timber harvest, the site was strongly dominated by Jordan's salamander. No significant effects of initial shelterwood cutting on Jordan's salamander abundance were apparent after timber harvest. Abundance of this species decreased from pre-cutting to post-cutting sampling on both control and treatment plots, which likely reflected the drought that characterized both post-cutting sampling periods, but not pre-cutting sampling. No emigration of salamanders from the cut plots was detected after timber harvest. These findings suggest that at a stand scale, shelterwood harvests may pose less of a short-term threat to salamander populations than clearcutting, but more study is necessary to assess broad-scale tradeoffs between harvest yield and biological impacts associated with alternative timber harvest methods. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2001 by V.

Relative abundance of Canada Warblers decreased over time on our West Virginia study area (Wildlife and Ecosystem Research Forest) and within the Appalachian Bird Conservation Region. Initially, relative abundance was greater closer to roads, but as timber harvests became more common, relative abundance became positively associated with amount of light partial harvests at the local scale. Nest survival was 45.6 +/- 18.3% during 1996-1998 and 24.9 +/- 14.6% during 2007-2009, but did not differ (P = 0.38) between these periods. Areas around nests in 2007-2009 (n = 17) had less intermediate canopy cover and fewer residual trees but more green cover, woody debris, and pole trees than areas around nests in 1996-1998 (n = 10). Successful nests had more low cover, less vertical diversity, more woody debris, more saplings, and greater edge density than failed nests. We found a positive association between relative abundance and all three types of timber harvests and an improvement in habitat through understory development and retention of residual trees. Our research finds preliminary support for use of timber harvests, particularly light partial harvests, as a management tool for Canada Warblers in the southern portion of their range with the need for extended research using treatments and controls to confirm successful management.

Most research on the relationship between avian abundance and active timber management has been short-term, lasting one to two years, creating the need to investigate long-term avian responses and to identify harvest thresholds when a small change in habitat results in a disproportionate response in relative abundance and nest success. Our objectives were to identify trends in relative abundance and nest success and to identify landscape-scale disturbance thresholds for avian species and habitat guilds in response to a variety of harvest treatments (clear-cuts, heavy and light partial harvests) over 14 years. We conducted point counts and monitored nests at an industrial forest in the central Appalachians of West Virginia during 1996-1998, 2001-2003, and 2007-2009. Early successional species increased in relative abundance across all three time periods, whereas interior-edge and forest-interior guilds peaked in relative abundance mid-study after which the forest-interior guild declined. Of 41 species with >10 detections, four (10%) declined significantly, 13 (32%) increased significantly (only three species among all periods), and 9 (22%) peaked in abundance mid-study (over the entire study period, four species had no significant change in abundance, four declined, and one increased). Based on piecewise linear models, forest-interior and interior-edge guilds' relative abundance harvest thresholds were 28% total harvests (all harvests combined), 10% clear-cut harvests, and 18% light partial harvests, after which abundances declined. Harvest thresholds for the early successional guild were 42% total harvests, 11% clear-cut harvest, and 10% light partial harvests, and relative abundances increased after surpassing thresholds albeit at a reduced rate of increase after the clear-cut threshold. Threshold confidence intervals for individual species overlapped their guild threshold intervals 91% of the time. Even though relative abundance of most species (80%) did not decline as the area affected by timber management increased, implementing management at or below our approximate forest-interior and interior-edge harvest thresholds would reduce the number of declining species by half, maintain higher relative abundances of four species with a net decline in abundance but that peaked in abundance mid-study, and maintain higher relative abundances of ten additional species. In contrast, this management strategy also would prevent the increase in relative abundance of seven species and limit the increase in abundance of three species that increased throughout the study."	262	3	449-460		biodiversity clear felling economic analysis forest management forest plantations forests habitats linear models logging profits species diversity species richness timbers wildlife	WV	38.7520419	-80.3751512	Mixed	"Picea rubens, Tsuga canadensis, Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, Prunus serotina, Quercus rubra, Betula lenta, Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus velutina, Quercus coccinea, Carya spp."	90	"Clearcutting, sheltewood cutting, single tree select harvest"	"At the study's inception, the WERF was primarily a 70- to 90- year-old even-aged mature forest that originated following logging during 1916-1928.

The degree that plant community composition persists or changes following disturbances depends on the balance between local extirpation and colonization by new species, including nonnatives. In this study, we examined species losses and gains, and entry of native vs. exotic species to determine how oak forests in the Appalachian Mountains might shift in species composition following a gradient of pulse disturbances (timber harvesting). We asked (1) how compositional stability of the plant community (resistance and resilience) was influenced by disturbance intensity, (2) whether community responses were driven by extirpation or colonization of species, and (3) how disturbance intensity influenced total and functional group diversity, including the nonnative proportion of the flora through time. We collected data at three spatial scales and three times, including just before, one year post-disturbance, and 10 years post-disturbance. Resistance was estimated using community distance measures between pre- and one Year post-disturbance, and resilience using community distance between pre- and 10-year post-disturbance conditions. The number of colonizing and extirpated species between sampling times was analyzed for all species combined and for six functional groups. Resistance and resilience decreased with increasing timber-harvesting disturbance; compositional stability was lower in the most disturbed plots, which Was driven by colonization, but not extirpation, of species.

An assessment of canopy stratification and tree species diversity following clearcutting in Central Appalachian hardwoods	Forest Science					"On high quality growing sites in West Virginia, shade intolerant tree species have increased in importance in third-generation forests following clearcutting. We investigated the effect of tree species canopy position on the Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index (H'), Pielou's evenness index (E), and species richness (S) using a chronosequence of 13 clearcuts. Two to 26 yr after clearcutting, tree species diversity significantly decreased from 2.07 to 1.83, and evenness decreased from 0.80 to 0.71 while species richness was maintained. As the number of years since harvesting increased, the importance value of oaks (Quercus L.), hickories (Carya Nutt.), American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and black birch (Betula lenta L.) decreased while the importance of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) increased. In these mixed-species stands with stratified canopies, species importance in overstory versus understory canopy layers was the best indicator of competitive success during stem exclusion. Second-generation forests that had almost equal representation of overstory sugar maple and yellow-poplar prior to harvesting had 43% yellow-poplar and 13% sugar maple overstory importance 22-26 yr after harvest. Forty-five percent of the dominant crown class stems and 54% of the codominant class were yellow-poplar. While sugar maple was also an important (13%) overstory species overall, it had no dominant and few codominant stems and over 30% importance as overtopped trees and in the understory. As these stands progress through the stem exclusion stage, richness and measures of diversity may continue declining as yellow-poplar basal area increases."	50	1	54-64		canopy clear felling deciduous forests forests lay	WV	39.0505231	-79.5544688	Broadleaf	"Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, Betula alleghaniensis, Carya Nutt."	63	logging	"Current forest composition on the Fernow Experimental Forest was influenced by human and natural disturbances. Logging from 1903 to 1911 (Trimble 1977) was heavy, but left behind scattered unwanted trees because of poor form, inadequate size, or species type (Schuler and Gillespie 2000). At the time, species considered undesirable included sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), black birch, yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) and hickory (Carya Nutt.). The chest- nut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) caused a 25% volume reduction in stands on the Fernow during the 1930s (Weitzman 1949). Grazing and fire have been absent from these stands since 1915 (Schuler and Gillespie 2000). Species composition was dominated by the Appalachian mixed- hardwood forest type (Smith et al. 1983).

Not only do pollinating insects help to maintain a diversity of plants within forests, but they also aid in pollinating crops found near forested land. Currently, the effects of various forest management practices on floral visiting insect abundance or diversity is unknown, so we investigated how prescribed burning, mechanical shrub control, and combination of the two affected abundance of floral visiting insects. We caught 7921 floral visitors from four orders and 21 families. Hymenoptera was the most abundant and diverse order, with Halictidae being the most abundant family. A total of 45 species of Hymenoptera representing six families were captured. We caught seven families and 35 species of Lepidoptera, six families and 33 species of Coleoptera, and two families and 13 species of Diptera. Most floral visitors were captured in the mechanical shrub control plus prescribed burn treatments, while lower numbers were caught on the mechanical shrub control only, prescribed burn only and control treatments. Overall species richness was also higher on mechanical plus burn treatments. Total pollinator abundance and the abundance of most orders and families was correlated with decreased tree basal area and increased percent herbaceous plant cover. Our study shows that floral visitors increased in abundance and species richness most from forest disturbance that reduced the density of overstory trees and increased the amount of herbaceous plant growth. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This loss has been attributed to habitat destruction and pesticide use, resulting in its status as a species of special concern. During the spring and summer of 2003 and 2004, we conducted butterfly surveys on forested 10-ha plots in the southern Appalachians of North Carolina in which various forest management practices had been applied. During one survey (June 2004), we observed male Diana fritillary butterflies feeding on flowering Oxydendrum arboretum (sourwood) within plots that had been mechanically thinned and burned.

Effects of prescribed fire and fire surrogates on saproxylic Coleoptera in the southern Appalachians of North Carolina	Journal of Entomological Science 			10.18474/0749-8004-43.1.57		"We examined the effects of forest management practices (prescribed burning, mechanical, and prescribed burn plus mechanical) on saproxylic forest Coleoptera in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. During the 2-yr study, we captured 37,191 Coleoptera with baited multiple-funnel traps and pipe traps, comprising 20 families and 122 species that were used for our analysis. Saproxylic beetle numbers increased greatly from the first year to the second year on all treatments. Species richness and total abundance of Coleoptera were not significantly affected by the treatments, but several families (e.g., Elateridae, Cleridae, Trogositidae, Scolytidae) were significantly more abundant on treated plots. Abundances of many species, including various species of Scolytidae were significantly affected by the treatments. However, these scolytids (Hylastes salebrosus Eichoff, Ips grandicollis Eichoff, Xyloborinus saxeseni Ratzburg, Xyleborus sp., Xyleborus atratus Eichoff) did not respond in the same way to the treatments. Likewise, other Coleoptera such as Pityophagus sp. (Nitidulidae), Hylobius pales Herbst (Curculionidae), and Xylotrechus sagittatus Germar (Cerambycidae) also varied in their responses to the treatments. Species richness was not significantly different for the spring 2003 trapping seasons, but the fall 2003 sample had a higher number of species on mechanical shrub removal only and mechanical shrub removal plus prescribed burning plots compared with controls. Linear regression analysis suggests that increased dead wood caused by hot fires on mechanical plus burn and burn only treatments resulted in increases among various Coleoptera families and species.

Using colored pan traps, we sampled flower visitors during the plant growing season between 2014 and 2016. We captured 5,520 flower visitors that were dominated by halictid bees and vespid wasps. Twenty genera of bees representing at least 30 species were captured within our experimental plots. Within the forest understory, we found higher abundances and diversities of bees and other flower visitors within plots that had been treated with prescribed fire or a combination of mechanical thinning and prescribed fire compared to control plots. Within our midstory samples, we found that forest management practices did not affect the abundance of any common flower visitor species/family. However, Augochlora pura and Vespula spp. were more abundant in the midstory compared to the forest understory. Overall, our study demonstrates that repeated applications of prescribed fire maintained elevated abundances and diversity of bees and other flower-visiting insects compared to untreated plots, likely due to increased herbaceous plant diversity and enhanced quality of nesting habitat within the understory. Our results also indicate that many flower visitors utilize the midstory of a temperate forest potentially for foraging habitat. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of American Foresters 2018."	64	3	299-306		Plants (botany); Forestry; Augochlora pura; Canopy; Ecosystems; Fires; Forest midstory; Pollina	NC	35.28583333	-82.32833333	Broadleaf	"Quercus spp., carya spp."			"Our study was part of the USDA National Fire and Fire Surrogate Study (NFFS, McIver et al. 2013) and was conducted within the Green River Game Land (Polk County, NC, blocks 1 and 2, 35¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√ª17¬¨‚Ä†≈ì√Ñ9N¬¨‚Ä†‚Äö√†¬¥, 82¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√ª19¬¨‚Ä†≈ì√Ñ42¬¨‚Ä†‚Äö√†¬¥W, block 3, 35¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√ª15¬¨‚Ä†≈ì√Ñ42¬¨‚Ä†‚Äö√†¬¥N, 82¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√ª17¬¨‚Ä†≈ì√Ñ27¬¨‚Ä†‚Äö√†¬¥W with elevation ranging from 366‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬®793 m [Greenberg et al. 2010]).

Movements of Allegheny woodrats in relation to timber harvesting	Journal of Wildlife Management			10.2307/3803288		"The Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) [N. floridana ] occurs in the US Appalachian Mountains, forming colonies in rock outcrops, cliffs, and caves. Populations on the northern and western peripheries of the range have experienced drastic declines in the past 20-30 years. Dependence upon rock outcrops makes Allegheny woodrats vulnerable to land use practices that alter habitats surrounding colonies. To examine the impacts of timber harvesting on Allegheny woodrat behaviour, we radiotracked 37 adults during summer 1998 and 1999 in clear fell, diameter-limit, and intact forest stands in the central Appalachians of West Virginia. Northern hardwood forest communities of American beech (Fagus grandifolia)-yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis)-maple (Acer spp.) dominated the study site. Home range size and foraging movements generally were greatest at diameter-limit sites and smallest in intact forests in 1998, following a poor mast crop. We detected no differences among harvest methods in 1999 when mast was abundant. We believe that when hard mast was scarce, woodrats increased foraging movements and home range size to locate mast or sufficient alternative foods. Additionally, woodrats used clear fell and adjacent forested areas in proportion to availability. Our results suggested that clear felling has minimal impact on woodrat movements, home range, and habitat use if sufficient intact forest is retained adjacent to colonies. Harvesting methods that selectively remove important mast-producing species may represent the greatest disturbance to Allegheny woodrats from forest management."	65	1	148-156		animal behaviour behaviour clear felling deciduous forests foraging forest management forest plantations forests habitat destruction habitat selection habitats logging movement seed production selective felling silvicultural systems wildlife conservatio	WV	38.8543785	-79.9913473	Broadleaf	"Betula allegheniensis, Acer spp., Liriodendron tulipifera, Q. rubra, Tilia spp., Fagus grandifolia, B. lenta, Prunus serotina, Picea rubens, Tsuga canadensis,Kalmia latifolia, Smilax spp."	80			CI	N	1998	4	2	2	1	Clearcutting;Selective methods	N	N	N	Field observation;Live trapping;Movement tracking	A	Mammals	N

Studies were undertaken to determine whether partial harvests in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in any long term changes in canopy structure that increased dogwood populations or reduced the severity of dogwood anthracnose (caused by Discula destructiva). Stand composition and severity of dogwood anthracnose were measured on 39 [broadleaved forest] plots located at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in western North Carolina, USA. The 0.08-ha plots were selected along transects across watersheds previously clearcut, partially harvested, or not harvested. Basal diam., percentage leaf area with dogwood anthracnose symptoms and percentage branch dieback were estimated for C. florida. Dogwood anthracnose was most severe on partially harvested watersheds and least severe on the clearcut watershed. Density of C. florida was greatest on the clearcut watershed and the number of dogwood stems was inversely correlated (r = -0.31, P = 0.05) with disease severity. Dogwood basal area, species importance value and stand basal area were not significantly affected by harvest treatment and were not correlated with disease severity. In a second study, anthracnose severity was rated in 21 plots of yellow poplar [Liriodendron tulipifera] near Asheville, North Carolina, that had been thinned to varying densities in the early 1960s. Among these 0.1-ha plots, thinning intensity did not affect disease severity.

Selection silviculture has been practiced on a limited scale in longleaf pine, but difficulty of using traditional approaches and absence of an evaluation across a range of site types has left managers in doubt about its suitability. This study was conducted to quantify the effects on understory plant communities of applying single-tree selection, group selection, irregular shelterwood and uniform shelterwood in longleaf pine forests on flatwoods and uplands of the southeastern United States. Wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana Trin. &amp; Rupr.) and numerous other graminoids are highly desirable understory species, because they facilitate the essential ecological process of recurrent surface fire that sustains longleaf pine ecosystems. Forbs such as partridge pea (Chamaecrista fasciculata (Michx.) Greene) and low shrubs such as gopherapple (Licania michauxii Prance), blueberries (Vaccinium spp. L.) and huckleberries (Gaylussacia spp. Kunth) are also desirable as components of good wildlife habitat. Selection treatments reduced stand basal area to ~11.5m2ha-1 and shelterwood treatments left a basal area of ~5.8m2ha-1. While higher levels of logging traffic from shelterwood treatment caused a significant decline in saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens W. Bartram) cover and increases in wiregrass at the flatwoods site, on the upland site it resulted in a sharp decline in wiregrass and silverthread goldaster (Pityopsis graminifolia (Michx.) Nutt.). Absence of prescribed fire during the post-treatment years led to progressive increases for shrub cover broadly across the flatwoods. Group selection caused modest understory change in flatwoods (temporary decrease in shrubs and increase in wiregrass), but resulted in a doubling of understory plant cover on uplands, with significant increases for hardwood tree seedlings, shrubs, vines, wiregrass, forbs and ferns.

We compared secondary production and standing crops of detritus in two mountain headwater streams within Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina, USA, as part of a long-term, paired-watershed investigation of macroinvertebrate recovery from whole-catchment logging. Mean annual habitat-weighted abundance and biomass in the disturbed stream (catchment entirely logged 26 years prior) did not differ from that of the reference stream, and secondary production was only 0.8 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM).m-2.year-1 greater in the disturbed stream (disturbed, 10.1; reference, 9.3). Taxonomic composition, shredder-scraper ratios, and North Carolina biotic index scores were more similar between streams than in previous years. However, mean annual standing crops of benthic organic matter (BOM) were much lower in the disturbed stream (167 g AFDM.m-2) than in the reference stream (339 g AFDM.m-2), and the disturbed stream supported greater macroinvertebrate biomass per unit BOM. We suggest that despite similarities in macroinvertebrate structure and function, past logging activity continues to influence consumer-resource relationships in the disturbed stream through enhanced resource quality."	67	7	1126-1134		aquatic animals aquatic invertebrates aquatic orga	NC	35.0597249	-83.4327454	Mixed	"Robinia pseudoacacia L., Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer rubrum"		Experimental forest	"The reference (Hugh White Creek) and disturbed (Big Hurricane Branch) streams were paired for study because of their many physical similarities (Table 1), and although quantitative pretreatment data are lacking, the macroinvertebrate communities of both streams were observed to be similar before logging (Gurtz and Wallace 1984). Prior to logging, both catchments were dominated by mixed hardwoods, including oaks (Quercus spp.), hickory (Carya spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.). After the 1977 cable logging of the entire catchment (except 16 ha on upper slopes and ridges), forest succession was allowed to progress undisturbed. Leaf area index (a measure of canopy cover) of the logged catchment (Elliott et al. 2002) and litter inputs to the disturbed stream (Webster et al. 1992) recovered within 10 years of deforestation. Recent forest inventories on the logged site report more basal area of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), L tulipifera, and A. rubrum and a distinct lack of oak and hickory species (Elliott et al. 2002). A dense understory of rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum L.) provides year-round shading of both stream channels. Further details of the 1977 clear-cut were reported by Swank et al.

Breeding bird surveys completed in 1994-1996 in two-age and clearcut harvests in the central Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, USA allowed us to document long-term changes in these stands. In 2005 and 2006, we conducted point counts in mature unharvested forest stands and in 19-26 year-old clearcut and two-age harvests from the original study and in younger clearcut and two-age stands (6-10 years old). We found differences in breeding bird metrics among these five treatments and temporal differences in the original stands. Although early-successional species are typically absent from group selection cuts, they were almost as common in young two-age stands as clearcuts, supporting two-age harvests as an alternative to clearcutting. Although older harvests had lower species richness and diversity, they were beginning to provide habitat for some species of late-successional forest songbirds that were absent or uncommon in young harvests. Overall, late-successional forest-interior species were more flexible in their use of different seral stages; several species used both age classes and harvest types in addition to mature forest, which may reflect the lack of edges in our heavily-forested landscape. Consequently, two-age management provides habitat for a diverse group of species as these stands mature and may be an ecologically sustainable alternative to clearcutting in landscapes where brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) are uncommon."	142	1	212-220		habitats; reproduction; species diversity; wild animals; forests; species richness; temporal variation; forest management; silviculture; stand characteristics; clear felling; wild birds; stand age; wildlife conservation; breeding	WV	38.7520419	-80.3751512	Broadleaf	"Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer spp., Quercus rubra, Prunus serotina, Betula spp., Fagus grandifolia"	10; 26 ; 80	timber harvesting	"Study sites were located in eastern deciduous forest, specifi- cally on the Monongahela National Forest (MNF) in Pocahon- tas, Randolph, and Tucker Counties, and the MeadWestvaco Wildlife and Ecosystem Research Forest (MWERF) in Randolph County, West Virginia, eastern USA.

Each of four 9.3-ha plots in each of four blocks was subject to one of the following treatments: removal of all snags and fallen logs, removal of fallen logs only, felling and girdling to simulate a catastrophic pulse of CWD, and control. Removal treatments were applied in 1996, and the felling or snag-creation treatment will be applied in 2000-2001. Monitoring of invertebrate, herptile, avian, and mammalian assemblages and CWD dynamics began immediately after CWD removal and continues through the present. Removal treatments resulted in a fivefold to tenfold reduction in CWD abundance. To date, significant differences among treatments have only been detected for a few animal taxa. However, preliminary results underscore the benefits of large-scale experiments. This experiment allowed unambiguous tests of hypotheses regarding the effect of CWD abundance on fauna.

Effects of repeated-stand entries on terrestrial salamanders and their habitat	Southeastern Naturalist		1528-7092	10.1656/058.012.0209	http://www.eaglehill.us/SENAonline/SENAregular.shtml	"In recent years, silivicultural methods have shifted away from clearcut harvesting towards greater retention of overstory trees through part or all of a rotation. However, little is known about the effects of partial harvesting on wildlife populations. Thus, we examined effects of high-leave shelterwood management on terrestrial salamanders prior to and after an initial harvest and a subsequent overstory removal harvest (ORH) 13 years later. On an experimental research site in southwestern Virginia, we compared changes in salamander captures in this plot to a clearcut and control plot 1994-1996 and 2007-2009. Compared to contemporaneous estimates from an unharvested control, salamander captures were lower on shelterwood and clearcut plots 2-years after the initial harvest (1996) and lower on the shelterwood plot 1- and 2-years after the ORH (2008, 2009). Captures of the most common species, Plethodon cinereus (Eastern Red-backed Salamanders), followed similar trends with fewer captures in both harvested plots 2-years after the initial harvest (1996), but only the ORH differed from the control 2-years after the second partial harvest (2009). Abundance of woody debris was greater in the shelterwood following the ORH but was more decayed in the control plot. The regenerating clearcut (14 years post-harvest) had deeper leaf litter and denser understory vegetation than the ORH. These data are some of the first available describing effects of multiple harvest entries on terrestrial salamanders and suggest cumulative negative impacts on salamanders may occur from partial harvesting systems. More long-term monitoring of salamander populations is justified in silvicultural systems with multiple entries within a rotation."	12	2	353-366		monitoring; effects; leaves; forest litter; litter (plant); silviculture; regeneration; wildlife; silvicultural systems; harvesting; clear felling; natural history; shelterwood system	VA	37.2886145	-80.463589	Broadleaf	"Quercus spp., Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer rubrum, Oxydendron arboretum, Pinus strobus"			"We compared the effects of several silvicultural treatments on terrestrial sala- manders on the Jefferson National Forest, Montgomery County, VA.

Few studies published, however, have examined both songbird populations and avian nest success among harvesting treatments, particularly in forested landscapes. We conducted a study in the Monongahela National Forest of West Virginia during the summers of 1993 to 1996 to compare breeding-bird abundance and daily nest survival rates among different sivicultural treatments: a two-age treatment (a type of deferred removal in which 37-49 mature trees/ha remain after a harvest until the next rotation), clearcutting treatments 15 years after harvest, unharvested forest surrounding the harvested stands, and unharvested stands not adjacent to cuts. Abundance and daily nest-survival rates did not differ among treatments (p>O.05) for four of the five species for which the most nests were found: Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludovicianus), Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), Veery (Catharus fuscescens), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus). Parasitism rates were low (6%), and most parasitized nests were associated with the two-age harvest treatment. A source-sink model for the Wood Thrush revealed that all treatments were likely population sources for this species. Thus, it appears that 15 years after harvest, cuts placed within otherwise extensively forested areas do not result in the type of edge effects (population sinks) observed in areas fragmented by agriculture in the midwestern United States. Further, because neither nest success nor avian abundance was lower in the two-age than clearcut harvests, we conclude that two-age management is a viable conservation alternative to clearcutting in large forested landscapes where Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism is not a concern."	15	5	1405-1415		United States breeding population conservation management ecol	WV	38.6277715	-79.8296797	Broadleaf	"Prunus serotina, Betula lenta, Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer saccharum, Prunus pensylvanica,Sassafras albidum, Oxydendrum arboreum)"	85		"The topography consists of low valleys dis- sected by northeast-southwest ridges (U.S. Forest Ser- vice 1986).

Macroinvertebrates were identified and compared using biotic indices. Comparisons were made between streams within the pre-harvest period and between the pre- and post-harvest periods to determine the effects of harvest. Differences in community structure were seen between pre- and post-harvest periods. These may have been influenced by environmental factors including, but not limited to, stream flow, water chemistry, and canopy cover."

Two watersheds served as references, with no timber harvesting, and two treatment watersheds were clearcut with retention of Streamside Management Zones (SMZs) according to Georgia BMPs for forestry. Bird communities were surveyed in each watershed before and after harvest by variable-distance transect surveys. The bird community surveyed in each watershed was divided into foraging, nesting, and disturbance guilds. A Partners In Flight (PIF) composite score-based index was used to calculate the conservation value (CV) of those communities. Among variables measured, disturbance guilds showed the most apparent response to harvesting. This response, considered in the context of the CV index response, indicated that there was some changeover from high priority disturbance-sensitive species to moderate/high priority disturbance-tolerant species resulting from harvesting. We recommend the use of PIF scores and associated CV indexes along with other bird community variables in investigations of the value of SMZs for songbirds."

Macroinvertebrate production and macrophyte growth were studied in logged and unlogged sections of a sand-bottomed, low-gradient, blackwater stream on the Coastal Plain of Virginia, U.S.A. A section of the catchment had been clear-cut 3 years prior to sampling. No logging occurred in the upstream area of the catchment, which had experienced almost no land disturbance by humans for over 100 years. 2. A primary difference among the logged and unlogged sections of the stream was in the abundance of macrophytes. The combined biomass of Sparganium americanum and of Chara sp. was over 300-times greater in the logged than the unlogged section. 3. Annual macroinvertebrate production in the sediment was higher in the unlogged section (41 g dry mass m-2) than in the logged section (25 g m-2). 4. Annual macroinvertebrate production on Sparganium was higher in the logged section (10 g m-2 of plant surface area) than in the unlogged section (6 g m-2). Annual production associated with Chara, which occurred only in the logged section, was 196 g m-2 of stream bottom covered by this plant. 5. Whole-stream annual macroinvertebrate production, calculated by summing habitat-specific production that was weighted by habitat availability, was greater in the logged section (103 g m-2) than in the unlogged section (41 g m-2). Sediments supported 99% of the annual production in the unlogged section, whereas macrophytes supported 76% in the logged section. 6. Much of the additional macroinvertebrate production in the logged section was by collector-filterers living on macrophytes. Production by collector-gatherers was also greater in the logged section, whereas production by other functional feeding groups changed little with logging. 7. Although logging along high-gradient, rocky streams also results in increased macroinvertebrate production, that increase often is stimulated by greater periphyton growth rather than the macrophyte growth observed in this low-gradient stream."	46	6	821-833		ecology; growth rate; logging; economic activity	VA	36.9937126	-77.1637635	Mixed	"Pinus taeda L., P. echinata, Liriodendron tulipifera L., Acer rubrum L., Quercus spp., Nyssa sylvatica Marsh"		"Logging, undisturbed"	"The catchment had not been logged for over 100 years and the canopy trees were mainly 70¬¨¬®¬¨¬±110 years old (Virginia Department of Forestry, personal communication)."

Changes in benthic invertebrate community structure following 16 years of forest succession after logging were examined by estimating benthic invertebrate abundance, biomass and secondary production in streams draining a forested reference and a recovering clear-cut catchment. Benthic invertebrate abundance was three times higher, and invertebrate biomass and production were two times higher in the disturbed stream. 2. Comparison of invertebrate community abundance 1, 5 and 16 years after clearcutting indicated that the proportion of scrapers had decreased, whereas shredders had increased. Functional group percentage similarity indicated that the invertebrate community in the disturbed stream 16 years after clear-cutting was more similar to the reference than to that found earlier in the disturbed stream. 3. The five indices calculated from data collected over the past 16 years, as well as the abundance, biomass and production data collected during this study, proved to be of differing value in assessing recovery of the disturbed stream from logging. Percent dominant taxon and EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) taxon richness failed to show any initial differences between reference and disturbed streams, indicating that these indices may not be useful for measuring recovery from logging. The percentage Baetis and shredder-scraper indices showed significant differences only during the 1977 study and suggest recovery (no difference between reference and disturbed) by 1982. The North Carolina Biotic Index showed continued differences during 1982 in the riffle and depositional habitats and recovery by 1993.

Forest structure affects trophic linkages: how silvicultural disturbance impacts bats and their insect prey	Forest Ecology and Management			10.1016/j.foreco.2011.12.016	http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811271100747X	"Vertebrate insectivores such as bats are a pervasive top-down force on prey populations in forest ecosystems. Conservation focusing on forest-dwelling bats requires understanding of community-level interactions between these predators and their insect prey. Our study assessed bat activity and insect occurrence (abundance and diversity) across a gradient of forest disturbance and structure (silvicultural treatments) in the Central Appalachian region of North America. We conducted acoustic surveys of bat echolocation concurrent with insect surveys using blacklight and malaise traps over 2 years. Predator activity, prey occurrence and prey biomass varied seasonally and across the region. The number of bat echolocation pulses was positively related with forest disturbance, whereas prey demonstrated varied trends. Lepidopteran abundance was negatively related with disturbance, while dipteran abundance and diversity was positively related with disturbance. Coleoptera were unaffected. Neither bat nor insect response variables differed between plot interiors and edges.

Over a 60,060 pitfall trapnight effort, we collected 3937 salamanders represented by Desmognathus aeneus, Desmognathus monticola, Desmognathus ocoee, Desmognathus quadramaculatus, Eurycea bislineata, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, Pseudotriton ruber, Plethodon glutinosus, Plethodon serratus, and Notophthalmus viridescens. Analysis of covariance with pitfall array to stream distance as the covariate showed that salamander species richness and diversity measures and numbers of Desmognathus aeneus and Desmognathus ocoee were highest in stands ?85 years. Eurycea bislineata and Plethodon glutinosus were more abundant in stands ?50 years old than in stands ?85 years. Within cove hardwood stands, species richness and diversity measures and relative abundances of Desmognathus spp. and Gyrinophilus porphyriticus were negatively correlated with distance to stream. Species richness and diversity were positively correlated to amounts of emergent rock. Species richness, diversity and relative abundances of Desmognathus spp. were correlated with basal area within stands and extent of connected mesic, cove hardwood habitat and amount of cove habitat within 1 km radius among stands. Eurycea bislineata was negatively correlated with landform index, a measure of surrounding landform sheltering, and Plethodon glutinosus was positively correlated with elevation in cove hardwood stands. Our research indicates stand age is an important factor in explaining the abundance and community composition of salamanders in southern Appalachian cove hardwood communities. Because southern Appalachian woodland salamander communities are slow to recover and are substantially changed following disturbances such as clearcutting, populations in small, isolated cove hardwood stands might be more vulnerable to extirpation or may require longer recovery times than those in larger coves. Managers may need to assess habitat features such as cove extent and habitat connectivity to minimize impacts on these taxa by forest management activities in southern Appalachian cove hardwood communities."	155		131-141		Amphibia Amphiuma means Caudata Desmognathus Biodiversity Hardwoods Landforms Drift-fence arrays Forestry United States amphibian clearcutting species diversity speci	GA	34.7659711	-84.1435136	Broadleaf	"Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus rubra, Quercus alba"	85			CI	N	1994	15; 25; 50	1	9	4	Clearcutting	N	N	N	Trapping	RA	Amphibians	N

Treatments were burn plots on upper slopes or lower slopes fenced to prevent white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory or control plots that were unfenced and unburned. Most of the 7 species we observed were the mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ocropheaus), red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) and slimy salamander (Plethodon glutinosis). Significant population responses were difficult to interpret with numerous treatment and year interactions. Results largely were equivocal. We found no change in woodland salamander assemblage prior to burning or afterwards. There were few differences in adult to juvenile ratios of salamanders among treatments. Still, a priori contrasts of mountain dusky salamanders and red-backed salamander counts corrected for detection probability were greater under coverboards in the 2 years monitored after both prescribed fires had occurred than before burning or in unburned controls. This suggests that these species responded to the reduced leaf litter on the forest floor by utilizing coverboards more. Similarly, the three predominate species of salamanders also were more numerous under coverboards in plots subjected to deer herbivory with less subsequent forest floor vegetation as compared to those burned plots that were fenced. Our observations would suggest that woodland salamanders somewhat are tolerant of two prescribed fires within close temporal proximity. However, because woodland salamanders can be significantly reduced following timber harvest, continued research is needed to fully understand impacts of fire as a pre-harvest management tool in central Appalachian forests. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2010 ."	260	6	1003-1009		Appalachian mountains Appalachians Apriori Dete Appalachians United States West Virginia Cervidae Desmognathus Desmognathus ochrophaeus Fires Fires Floors Forestry Harvesting Land Plants Floors Forestry Harvesting Landforms Vegetati age structure amphib	WV	39.03	-79.67	Broadleaf	"Quercus rubra, Quercus prinus, Quercus. alba"				CI	N	2002	4	4	20	4	Controlled burn	N	N	N	Trapping	A	Amphibians	N

Ground-dwelling macroarthropods also were collected from a subset of pitfall traps to assess relative prey availability among the treatments. Four experimental units, each >14 ha were contained within each of three replicate blocks. Treatments were (1) prescribed burning; (2) mechanical felling of shrubs and small trees; (3) mechanical felling + burning; (4) forested controls. Mechanical understory felling treatments were conducted in winter 2001-2002, and prescribed burning was conducted in March 2003. High-intensity fires and high tree mortality increased canopy openness in mechanical felling + burn treatment compared to the others. Burning reduced leaf litter depth in both the burned treatments (burn only and mechanical felling + burn), whereas mechanical understory felling alone increased leaf litter depth in that treatment. Dry biomass of ground-dwelling macroarthropods was similar among the treatments and control. We collected a total of 269 shrews of four species during 2003 and 2004, including northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda), smokey shrews (Sorex fumeus), pygmy shrews (S. hoyi), and southeastern shrews (S. longirostris). Relative abundance of all shrews combined and pygmy shrews was lowest in the mechanical felling + burn treatment, but differed significantly only from the mechanical understory felling treatment where the contrast in leaf litter depth was high. Our results indicate that low-intensity fuel reduction treatments, with minimal change to canopy cover or leaf litter depth, have little impact on shrews. However, high-intensity disturbance, such as prescribed burning that kills trees and dramatically reduces shade and leaf litter depth, can reduce the abundance of some shrew species and all shrews combined, at least in the short term. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2007."	243		231-236		North America; North Carolina; Animals; forest fire; Appalachians; environmental disturbance; arthropod; Blarina brevicauda; Hardwood forest; Fuel reduction; Sorex hoyi; Forestry; Fire resistance; Fire Resistance; Forest Fires; Forest Li; Hardwoods; Leaf litter dept; Sor; Sorex fumeus; Unit	NC	35.2833333	-82.3166667	Mixed	"Quercus spp., Carya spp., Pinus echinata, Pinus virginiana, Pinus strobus, Liriodendron tulipifera, Kalmia latifolia, Rhododendron maximum)"	120		"None of the sites had been thinned or burned for at least 50 years (Dean Simon, North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, personal commu- nication)."

Changes to forest structure and microclimate may adversely affect some taxa (e.g., terrestrial salamanders), but positively affect others (e.g., early successional birds). Salamanders are cited as indicators of ecosystem health because of their sensitivity to forest floor microclimate. We used drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps in a replicated Before-After-Control-Impact design to experimentally assess herpetofaunal community response to initial application of three silvicultural methods proposed to promote oak regeneration: prescribed burning; midstory herbicide; and shelterwood harvests (initial treatment of the shelterwood-burn method) and controls, before and for five years post-treatment. Species richness of all herpetofauna, amphibians, reptiles, frogs, salamanders, or snakes was unaffected by any treatment, but lizard species richness increased in the shelterwood harvest. Capture rate of total salamanders decreased post-harvest in shelterwood units after a 2-3 year delay; Plethodon teyahalee decreased post-harvest in shelterwoods, but also in control units. In contrast, capture rate of total lizards and Plestiodon fasciatus increased in shelterwood stands within the first year post-harvest.

Changes to forest structure and microclimate may adversely affect some taxa (e.g., terrestrial salamanders), but positively affect others (e.g., early successional birds). Salamanders are cited as indicators of ecosystem health because of their sensitivity to forest floor microclimate. We used drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps in a replicated Before-After-Control-Impact design to experimentally assess herpetofaunal community response to initial application of three silvicultural methods proposed to promote oak regeneration: prescribed burning; midstory herbicide; and shelterwood harvests (initial treatment of the shelterwood-burn method) and controls, before and for five years post-treatment. Species richness of all herpetofauna, amphibians, reptiles, frogs, salamanders, or snakes was unaffected by any treatment, but lizard species richness increased in the shelterwood harvest. Capture rate of total salamanders decreased post-harvest in shelterwood units after a 2-3 year delay; Plethodon teyahalee decreased post-harvest in shelterwoods, but also in control units. In contrast, capture rate of total lizards and Plestiodon fasciatus increased in shelterwood stands within the first year post-harvest. Prescribed burn and midstory herbicide treatments did not affect any reptile or amphibian species. A marginally lower proportion of juvenile to adult P. teyahalee, and a higher proportion of juvenile P. fasciatus in shelterwood than control units suggested that heavy canopy removal and associated change in microclimate may differentially affect reproductive success among species.

Many species of reptiles and amphibians are ground-dwelling, potentially increasing their vulnerability to prescribed fire, especially during the growing-season when they are most active. We used drift fences with pitfall traps to experimentally assess how herpetofaunal species and communities responded to early, growing-season burns, dormant-season burns, and unburned controls. We documented no adverse effects of either growing season burns or dormant-season burns on any common herpetofaunal taxa, but capture rates of total, adult, and juvenile five-lined skinks (Plestiodon fasciatus) were greater following growing-season burns. Most measurements reflected little or transient change in forest structure. However, canopy cover decreased by an average of 16% in growing-season burns within four growing-seasons of burning, with some tree mortality in patches where fire temperature likely was hotter. Our study suggests that even modest reductions in canopy cover may positively affect relative abundance and reproductive success of P. fasciatus. We cautiously suggest that a higher mean ground-level fire temperature and the physiologically active condition of vegetation in growing-season burns interacted to damage a greater proportion of trees, resulting in more canopy thinning than in dormant-season burns. However, weather, fuel types and condition, vegetation structure, and topography interact to affect fire intensity and the level of mortality or damage to canopy trees within and among stands, regardless of season conducted.

The study area was located on the southern end of the mid-Cumberland Plateau in northern Jackson County, AL. Fifteen 4-ha stands were treated in 2001 with one of five target overstory retention (percentage) treatments: 0 (clearcut); 25; 50; 75; and 100 (control). In 2010-2011, the residual trees in the initial 25, 50, 75, and 100 (control) percent retention stands were harvested, and three new controls were added, which resulted in three forest stand cohorts: (1) mature (control, not harvested for 50 to 70 years); (2) 10-year-old regenerated clearcut; and (3) final harvest of the shelterwood prescriptions (25, 50, 75, and 100 percent retention stands in 2001). Breeding songbirds were surveyed 9 to 10 times per year during the peak of breeding season (April to July) of 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Territory mapping was used based on detections in each year in each stand. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test were used to compare average territory density among treatments and years. Results of temporal responses of two breeding songbird conservation concern species, Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa) and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum), to treatments showed that responses were treatment-dependent. Territory density of Kentucky Warbler (an interior-edge species) showed positive response to 50 percent retention stands.

Fire suppression in the central Appalachian region for almost a century has contributed to a transition from oak-dominated to more mesophytic, fire-intolerant forest communities. Prescribed fire coupled with timber removal is currently implemented to aid in oak regeneration and establishment but responses of woodland salamanders to this complex silvicultural system is poorly documented. The purpose of our research was to determine how woodland salamanders respond to shelterwood harvests following successive burns in a central Appalachian mixed-oak forest. Woodland salamanders were surveyed using coverboard arrays in May, July, and August-September 2011 and 2012. Surveys were conducted within fenced shelterwood-burn (prescribed fires, shelterwood harvest, and fencing to prevent white-tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus] herbivory), shelterwood-burn (prescribed fires and shelterwood harvest), and control plots. Relative abundance was modeled in relation to habitat variables measured within treatments for mountain dusky salamanders (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), slimy salamanders (Plethodon glutinosus), and eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus). Mountain dusky salamander relative abundance was positively associated with canopy cover and there were significantly more individuals within controls than either shelterwood-burn or fenced shelterwood-burn treatments. Conversely, habitat variables associated with slimy salamanders and eastern red-backed salamanders did not differ among treatments. Salamander age-class structure within controls did not differ from shelterwood-burn or fenced shelterwood-burn treatments for any species. Overall, the woodland salamander assemblage remained relatively intact throughout the shelterwood-burn silvicultural treatment compared to previous research within the same study area that examined pre-harvest fire effects. However, because of the multi-faceted complexities of this specific silvicultural system, continued research is warranted that evaluates long-term, additive impacts on woodland salamanders within managed central Appalachian deciduous forests."	359		277-285		Biological Resources (General) [PP700] Forests and	WV	39.0542734	-79.6700617	Mixed	"Quercus rubra, Quercus prinus, Quercus alba, Carya ovata, Carya cordi- formis, Fagus grandifolia, Acer saccharum, Nyssa sylvatica, Tsuga canadensis"		"experimental forest, logging"	The Fernow Experimental Forest was extensively logged during 1903‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬®1911	CI	N	2011	9	2	20	4	Shelterwood;Controlled burn	N	N	N	Field observation;Quadrat	A	Amphibians	Y	Desmognathus ochrophaeus	Amphibians

Total shrew captures did not differ among treatment areas in either year. Decreases in leaf litter, duff depth, and canopy cover in mechanical + twice-burned treatment areas may have decreased ground-level moisture, thereby causing short-term declines in southeastern shrew captures.

Trapping was conducted seasonally between autumn 1997 and summer 2001. Capture rates of Cryptotis parva were lower at plots from which CWD was removed than at control plots (P=0.011) and declined at all plots over the study period (P<0.001). Capture rates of Blarina carolinensis (P=0.129) and Sorex longirostris (P=0.432) did not differ between removal and control plots, but declined over the study period (P<0.001). Age distributions of B. carolinensis differed between removal and control plots (P=0.048) with a smaller proportion of individuals in young age categories at removal plots. Sensitivity of Cryptotis to the removal of CWD may have been due to its sociality or low population density at the study area. A reduction in the abundance of young B. carolinensis after removal of CWD may reflect reduced reproduction and immigration of older individuals from outside the plot. Effect of removal of CWD on populations of these shrews was relatively weak compared to strong seasonal and multi-year variation in abundance. However, weak treatment effects may have been partly due to low ambient levels of CWD at control plots. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Therein, we sampled shrews during winter, spring, and summer seasons, 2003-2005, using drift-fence pitfall arrays. During 1680 drift-fence plot nights we captured 253 Blarina carolinensis, 154 Sorex longirostris, and 51 Cryptotis parva. Blarina carolinensis capture rate was greater in control than in snag treatments. Sorex longirostris capture rate was lower in removal than downed and control plots in 2005 whereas C. parva capture rate did not differ among treatments. Overall, the CWD input treatments failed to elicit the positive soricid response we had expected. Lack of a positive response by soricid populations to our downed treatments may be attributable to the early CWD decay stage within these plots or an indication that within fire-adapted pine-dominated systems of the Southeast, reliance on CWD is less than in other forest types."	255	7	2306-2311		trees; woody plants; forests; forest litter; coniferous forests; removal; forest management; dead wood; pines; coarse woody debris	SC	30.0069444	-81.4327443	Mixed	"Pinus taeda, Pinus palustris, Pinus elliottii, Lespedeza spp., Toxicodendron pubescens, Andropogon spp."	50	pine plantation		CI	N	2003	7	3	9	3	Woody residues removal	N	Y	Y	Trapping	A	Mammals	Y	"Blarina carolinensis, Sorex longirostris"	Mammals

Our goal was to determine effects of management alternatives on multiple system components, including biodiversity, medicinal plants, timber production, terrestrial amphibians, soil disturbance, invasive exotic plants, soil and leaf litter invertebrates, leaf litter decomposition rates and nutrient flux. Plant species richness increased with increasing canopy disturbance, through colonization both by shade-intolerant native species and by exotic species. We detected several species of medicinal plants. Oak regeneration depended more on site quality than treatment. Terrestrial salamander populations declined precipitously on all treatments subjected to canopy disturbance. Although initial soil loss was reduced by using treatments that retained higher levels of basal area in the stand, over a complete rotation, the effects of repeated entries are likely to cause greater soil loss than a clearcut and greater impacts on salamanders."

This study investigates one genus of ground beetles that lives in managed forested landscapes to discover which species are positively and negatively influenced by human disturbances. Ground beetles (Carabidae) were collected from a bottomland hardwood forest in the Mississippi River floodplain that received three harvesting treatments in 1995 (three replicates each of clearcut, selection, and control). Beetles were analyzed to assess the effects of forest disturbance over time. Four species in the genus Brachinus accounted for about 66 percent of all specimens collected. Brachinus larvae are ectoparasites on the pupae of water beetles, and the adults prefer moist habitats. In 1996, the year after applying treatments, the selection cuts yielded almost three times as many Brachinus (63 percent of 3,696 total) as the control (19 percent) and clearcut (19 percent) treatments. One year later, in 1997, both the control (45 percent of 2,572 total) and selection cuts (40 percent) yielded almost three times the number of Brachinus than the clearcuts (14 percent). In 2000 (an exceptionally dry summer), both the control (44 percent of 465 total) and selection cuts (45 percent) yielded four times the number of Brachinus than the clearcuts (11 percent). The steady loss of beetles during the study is believed to be due to several summer floods followed by several summer droughts. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates that the selection cuts continued to provide the habitat needs of these beetles, and the clearcuts continued to provide less suitable habitat, despite a lush growth of plants in 2000."	92		459-463		Soil Biology [JJ100] Silviculture and Forest Manag	MS	32.9209771	-91.1785862	Broadleaf	"Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Carya illinoinensis, Quercus texana"				BA	N	1995	1; 5	6	3	3	Selection system;Clearcutting	N	N	N	Trapping	A	Invertebrates (land)	Y	clearcuts worse than selection cuts	Invertebrates (land)

Effects of even-aged timber harvest on stream salamanders: Support for the evacuation hypothesis	Forest Ecology and Management			10.1016/j.foreco.2011.08.030		"Habitats worldwide are increasingly threatened by degradation and conversion. Critical to the process of habitat loss is the organismal response, which can have effects on immediate conservation measures or future restoration. Among the most threatened and underappreciated habitats are headwater streams, which are small but abundant features of montane forests. These habitats comprise a significant proportion of the total stream length, can harbor remarkable biodiversity, and are critical for numerous ecosystem processes. One of the most abundant organisms in montane headwater ecosystems are salamanders, and therefore what happens to salamanders when the forest habitats surrounding headwater streams are altered? Three main hypotheses exist: (1) mortality hypothesis; (2) retreat hypothesis; and (3) evacuation hypothesis. To examine these hypotheses we evaluated the impacts of even-aged riparian timber harvest on stream-breeding salamanders. Riparian forests along headwater streams were logged, leaving riparian buffers of 0 m, 9 m, and 30 m. Responses to each riparian alteration were measured in terms of salamander terrestrial habitat use and growth in the riparian habitat, as well as changes in population density within headwater streams. Adult and juvenile salamander densities measured in headwater streams were significantly greater in logged riparian treatments than in unaltered riparian treatments. In addition, salamanders significantly reduced their terrestrial habitat use following riparian logging with both the average distance from the stream and the relative abundance of salamanders decreasing. It is unlikely that salamanders will persist in highly modified riparian habitats, as we measured significantly reduced body conditions over short periods of time at these sites. We present corroborative evidence that salamanders evacuate the riparian habitat following intensive riparian logging, emigrating to adjacent headwater streams. Our results underscore the sensitivity of stream salamanders to riparian habitat alteration as well as the importance of riparian buffers in preserving amphibian assemblages. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These streams provide a wealth of ecosystem services and support tremendous biological diversity, which is predominated by salamanders in the Appalachian region. Salamanders are ubiquitous throughout the region, contributing a significant biomass that supports ecological and ecosystem processes. One of the greatest threats to salamanders is loss of headwater-riparian habitat through timber harvest. In this study, we measured larval salamander abundance at five headwater streams with different riparian buffer widths retained following logging. By sampling larval salamanders using leaf litter bags, we assessed the impacts of even-aged timber harvest on aquatic larval salamander abundances, where it was found that larvae are negatively impacted by increased stream sedimentation and a decrease in riparian buffer width. We found that retention of a 9-m buffer was effectively no different than complete removal of all riparian forest, and as such, current regulations to protect headwater streams are ineffectual. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the 30 m buffer treatment and uncut control treatments suggesting that a 30 m or larger riparian buffer may assuage the in-stream effects of riparian timber harvest. Management guidelines for Appalachian forests should be revised to accommodate the biology of plethodontid salamanders. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Songbird species respond both negatively and positively to these systems, and ornithologists suggest these techniques can be used when managing for songbirds at the stand and landscape levels. However, little is known about the effects of diameter-limit harvesting on songbird abundances and their reproductive success. We evaluated the effects of this technique on songbird populations at the Westvaco Wildlife and Ecosystem Research Forest (WWERF) in the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia. The area is an industrial forest composed predominantly of Appalachian hardwoods 60-80 years old. We examined songbird abundances throughout the forest and nesting success on four 40 ha plots in 1996. In 1997, two plots were harvested using the diameter-limit technique where most trees ?45.7 cm were removed. Abundance and nesting success were monitored again in 1997 and 1998. Results indicate that the abundances of most songbird species present prior to harvest changed little after the timber removal. Two species, the Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis) and dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), were more abundant in harvested areas than unharvested forest. One habitat group, interior/edge species, and total abundance of songbirds also had higher abundance in harvested areas. Overall nest survival in harvested areas was higher both 1- (37.7%) and 2-years (46.4%) after harvesting than before harvesting (14.9%). Only large-diameter trees were removed on the WWERF, and intermediate and subcanopy trees remained standing, retaining considerable structural heterogeneity. Stands that were harvested differed from unharvested stands by having more snags, higher density of trees ?8-14.9 cm, and a higher percent cover of down wood. Canopy cover over 24 m, density of saplings, and the amount of leaf litter decreased after harvesting, while canopy cover ?0.5-3 m and the percent of bareground increased. Diameter-limit harvesting at the low intensity in our study might not adversely affect forest-dwelling songbirds in the central Appalachians in the short-term and forest bird communities could be retained. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Influence of fallen coarse woody debris on the diversity and community structure of forest-floor spiders (Arachnida: Araneae)	Forest Ecology And Management			10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.051		"Purely observational studies have documented differences in the abundance and diversity of several litter-dwelling arthropods between sites adjacent to, and far from, CWD, which suggests that reduction of fallen coarse woody debris (CWD) in temperate forests by traditional forestry practices may affect the litter arthropod community. As few field experiments have directly tested the impact of CWD on arthropods inhabiting the litter at different distances from CWD, we removed CWD from replicated open plots on the floor of a second-growth deciduous forest in order to reveal the causal connection between CWD and litter-dwelling spiders, often the most diverse and abundant predators among the litter macrofauna of temperate forests. We also documented the impact of the CWD manipulation on spider prey and several other major macroarthropod groups. Before removing CWD (phi = 14.3 +/- 0.7 cm), we measured response variables as a function of distance (0.5-1.5 m) from CWD in both removal and control plots. In agreement with results of previous research that solely utilized this observational approach in temperate forests, volume and dry mass of litter, spider diversity, overall spider density, and densities of 8 of 16 major spider genera were higher adjacent to CWD before experimental manipulations. Removing CWD reduced the amount of litter and the density of spiders in litter close to where the CWD had been. Removing CWD also altered spider community structure, which had differed between litter sites adjacent to, and far from, CWD prior to the experimental removal of CWD. The patterns, though, were not completely congruent, as some of the taxa affected by the manipulation had not differed between sites prior to the removal of CWD, and vice-versa. Our findings suggest that complex interactions among structural, biotic and microclimatic factors underlie the observed responses to CWD removal by spiders and other arthropods in the litter layer. We also conclude that drawing inferences solely from observational studies is not a reliable approach for predicting the impact of changes in the amount of CWD on arthropods of forest-floor leaf litter. Further field experiments manipulating different volumes of CWD are needed in order to determine the minimum amount of CWD that should be kept on the forest floor of managed forests in order to maintain densities and diversities of major leaf-litter arthropods.

In 2004, a non-native wood-boring pest, Sirex noctilio F., was found established in North America. Because S. noctilio is an economically important pest in pine plantations throughout the Southern Hemisphere, interest in the ecology of American native wood wasp populations has increased. A study was conducted during fall 2011 to investigate the effects of forest stand type and characteristics on native wood wasp abundance, and to describe their flight phenology in northeastern Mississippi. In total, 609 native wood wasps were captured, consisting of 608 Sirex nigricornis F. and one Urocerus cressoni Norton. There were significant treatment and location effects that influenced wood wasp abundance. The flight period of wood wasps captured in our study (October-December) was similar to studies in the southeastern United States, but differed from results in Minnesota and the northeastern United States (June-October). Wood wasp abundance was significantly correlated with higher basal area, smaller tree diameter at breast height, and shorter trees, all indicators of forest stand stress. It appears proper silvicultural management of pine plantations may reduce native wood wasp population abundance in the southeastern United States, as it does to S. noctilio in the Southern Hemisphere. We propose implementing management models used for the southern pine beetle to reduce stand hazard of future infestations of native and invasive wood wasps."	107	3	1142-1149		ecology economic impact effects entomology fauna forest management forests impact indicators infestation models phenology pines plantations silviculture trees wood wood borers woody plants invasive species	MS	33.425408	-89.1590553	Mixed			pine plantation		CI	N	2011	10	1	36	12	Plantation silviculture	N	N	N	Trapping	A	Invertebrates (land)	N

Comparisons were made in plots established after shearing and on-site chipping of a low quality hardwood stand on the Cumberland Plateau near Sewanee, TN in 1976. In 3 of the 6 plots representing each species, stems over 1.3 meters tall were injected with herbicide during the winter after harvest. Six years after planting, half of each eastern white pine plot was cleaned by manually or chemically removing only those trees essential to release the overtopped white pines. Three additional plots were installed in 2000 in the surrounding mature forest. Data collected in 2000 included species presence and cover class for a log10 series of nested square subquadrats (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 100 square meters) within a 900 square meter quadrat for each of the 0.4 hectare plots. A total of 159 plant species (excluding grasses) were encountered within the twenty-seven 900 square meter plots. Sixty-three were found in all 5 stand types. Thirty-nine were found in only one stand type, with the largest number (10) found in loblolly pine and yellow-poplar. Plant species richness beneath the loblolly pine was not significantly different from planted yellow-poplar, natural regeneration, or the surrounding older hardwood forest. Eastern white pine, however, exhibited reduced plant richness relative to the other stand types. The effects of tree injection on plant richness varied with stand type and plant form. While woody plant species declined slightly in all plot types, herbaceous species tended to decline in pine plots and increase in the hardwood plots. The effects of successive competition treatments on plant species richness in eastern white pine were cumulative (average 4.5 species per treatment)"		SRS-48	599-604			TN	35.20833333	-85.91666667	Plantation	"Pinus taeda, Pinus strobus, Liriodendron tulipifera"		regeneration		CI	N	1976	24	24	3	3	Mechanical felling;Post harvest	N	N	N	Field observation	A	Vascular plants	N

"Effects of clearcutting with corridor retention on abundance, richness, and diversity of small mammals in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina, USA"	Forest Ecology and Management					"We studied six pine plantations in coastal South Carolina to determine the influence of clearcutting with corridor retention on small mammal abundance, richness, and diversity. Small mammals were live-trapped in recently clearcut stands that retained pine corridors 100 m in width and in adjacent pine plantations, 20-23-years-old. We compared small mammal communities between harvested stands with corridors and non-harvested pine stands. We captured 1158 small mammals, representing 844 unique individuals and seven different species in 94,080 trap nights. Rodent abundance, richness, and diversity indices were greater in harvested stands with corridors than in non-harvested pine stands. The early successional habitat created by clearcutting was used by many small mammal species, including cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) and marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris). Species composition of small mammals within the corridor habitats was similar to that in the non-harvested pine stands. The inclusion of corridors in pine plantation management enhances habitat diversity and ecosystem maintenance and contributes to local diversity of the small mammal community. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, the success of Biomass Harvesting Guidelines at reaching sustainability goals, including conservation of wildlife habitat, has not been tested in an operational setting. Thus, we compared shrew captures among six woody biomass harvesting treatments in pine plantations in North Carolina, USA from April to August 2011-2014 ( n= 4) and Georgia, USA from April to August 2011-2013 ( n= 4). Treatments included: (1) woody biomass harvest with no BHGs; (2) 15% retention with woody biomass dispersed; (3) 15% retention with woody biomass clustered; (4) 30% retention with woody biomass dispersed; (5) 30% retention with woody biomass clustered; and (6) no woody biomass harvested. We sampled shrews with drift fence arrays and compared relative abundance of shrews among treatments using analysis of variance. Additionally, we used general linear regression models to evaluate the influence of downed woody debris volume and vegetation structure on shrew capture success at each drift fence for species with >100 captures/state/year. In 53,690 trap nights, we had 1,712 shrew captures representing three species, Cryptotis parva, Blarina carolinensis, and Sorex longirostris.

Biomass Harvesting Guidelines (BHGs) recommend retaining a portion of woody biomass on the forest floor following harvest. Despite BHGs being developed to help ensure ecological sustainability, their contribution to biodiversity has not been evaluated experimentally at operational scales. We compared herpetofauanal evenness, diversity, and richness and abundance of Anaxyrus terrestris and Gastrophryne carolinensis among six treatments that varied in volume and spatial arrangement of woody biomass retained after clearcutting loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in North Carolina, USA (n = 4), 2011-2014 and Georgia (n = 4), USA 2011-2013. Treatments were: (1) biomass harvest with no BHGs, (2) 15% retention with biomass clustered, (3) 15% retention with biomass dispersed, (4) 30% retention with biomass clustered, (5) 30% retention with biomass dispersed, and (6) no biomass harvest. We captured individuals with drift fence arrays and compared evenness, diversity, and richness metrics among treatments with repeated-measure, linear mixed-effects models. We determined predictors of A. terrestris and G. carolinensis abundances using a priori candidate N-mixture models with woody biomass volume, vegetation structure, and groundcover composition as covariates. We had 206 captures of 25 reptile species and 8710 captures of 17 amphibian species during 53 690 trap nights. Herpetofauna diversity, evenness, and richness were similar among treatments. A. terrestris abundance was negatively related to volume of retained woody biomass in treatment units in North Carolina in 2013. G. carolinensis abundance was positively related with volume of retained woody debris in treatment units in Georgia in 2012.

Agencies 50					"Clearcutting has been reduced in frequency in national forests of Arkansas. This will affect populations of birds that require early successional forest habitat. I studied avian distribution, abundance, and reproductive success in young (i.e., 7 to 10 years post-harvest) and old (i.e., 17 to 19 years post-harvest) forest clearcuts from 1993 to 1995. The number of species was greater in young than old clearcuts, with abundance of 5 species, white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens), and indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) higher in young clearcuts. No difference in fledging success was detected between young and old clearcuts for any species, however, the ratio of hatching-year to after hatching-year birds captured in mist-nets was lower in older clearcuts for every species studied. Given the documented peaks in numbers of species and population size for early successional birds, maintaining habitat structure similar to that found on young clearcuts 7 to 10 years after site preparation is recommended to sustain early successional species in forests in Arkansas."			237-245	Southeastern Association Fish & Wildlife Agencies (Seafwa)		AK	34.7478943	-93.6677637	Conifer	"Pinus echinata, Quercus spp., Carya spp., Acer spp., Ulmus spp., Nyssa spp., Liquidambar spp"	10;19	pine regeneration		CI	N	1993	10; 19	2	1	1	Clearcutting	N	N	N	Field observation;Trapping	A	Birds	N

Because only minimal information exists about how current establishment practices affect wintering birds in managed forests, we documented effects of five pine plantation establishment practices that varied in intensity on wintering birds during years 1 through 5 postestablishment in the Coastal Plain of Mississippi. Using mixed general linear models, we compared species richness, total bird abundance, and individual species abundance. During the first 5 years, species richness and total abundance were greatest in the chemical-only establishment practice, whereas species richness and total abundance were lower in mechanical site preparation establishments with increasingly intensive chemical herbaceous controls. For five common species with treatment effects, abundance generally was greatest in the chemical-only establishment practice and abundance decreased as establishment intensity increased. Increasing stand establishment intensity in mechanical-prepared treatments generally reduced presence of wintering avian species in young pine plantations of the Lower Coastal Plain. Conversely, tree and snag retention facilitated by chemical-only site preparation may enrich avian assemblages in intensively established pine plantations.

We assessed the influence of 2 types of practices, two-age and clearcutting, on invertebrate biomass and avian daily nest survival in the Monongahela National Forest of West Virginia during summers of 1995 and 1996. We also examined relationships between invertebrate biomass, avian daily nest survival, and wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) nestling growth rates. Mean total invertebrate biomass collected per sample day and litter-dwelling invertebrates collected per sample day were 0.0614 g and 0.0254 g greater (P?O.10), respectively, in the unharvested than clearcut treatment late in the season (2 Jun to 12 Jul) when most birds had young in the nest; whereas invertebrates that hide under tree bark during the day had greatest biomass (P=O.O03) in the two-age treatment during this same time period (0.1355 g greater than clearcut and 0.0616 g greater than unharvested). In addition, daily nest survival rates (216 nests) were greater in the unharvested than two-age treatment (P?O.05). The lesser daily nest survival rates of birds breeding in the harvested treatments may be due to increased predator activity within these areas and/or reduced food supplies. Significant positive correlations between invertebrate biomass and daily nest survival rates of breeding birds and faster growth rates of wood thrush nestlings in stands with a greater invertebrate biomass suggest that changes in invertebrate biomass caused by silvicultural practices have an influence on breeding birds within these areas."	28	4	1123-1131		insect biomass nest predation nest survival silvic	WV	38.6278048	-79.838649	Unspecified	"Prunus serotina, Betula lenta, Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer saccharum, Acer rubrum, Prunus pensylvanica, Sassafras albidum, Oxydendrum arboreum"	85			CI	N	1996	16		6	6	Deferment harvest;Clearcutting	N	N	N	Trapping	A	Invertebrates (land)	N

Four experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3 replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North Carolina, USA. The upland hardwood forest was composed mainly of oaks (Quercus) and hickories (Carya). Treatments were (1) prescribed burn, (2) mechanical understorey reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), (3) mechanical + burn, and (4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls. Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understorey and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understorey removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging."	71	6	1906-1916		wild animals; forests; population density; fire effects; deciduous forests; felling; forest management; silviculture; controlled burning; thinning; wild birds; behaviour; reproductive behaviour; wildlife management; wildlife conservation	NC	35.2966594	-82.4405353	Mixed	"Carya spp., Pinus echinata, P. virginian, P. strobus, Kalmia latifolia, Rhododendron maximum"	50			BACI	N	2001	3	3	8	4	Controlled burn;Understorey removal	N	Y	Y	Field observation;Transect	RA	Birds	N

We examined breeding bird response to habitat restoration in longleaf pine sandhill forests of northwest Florida, USA. We compared habitat variables and abundance of breeding birds among 3 hardwood reduction techniques (prescribed spring burning, herbicide application, mechanical felling-girdling) and maintenance of fire exclusion (control). We also examined abundance of breeding birds in fire-maintained, non-experimental reference sites as a means to gauge management success based on similarity analysis. All 3 hardwood reduction methods decreased midstory hardwoods and canopy cover, and increased herbaceous cover compared with fire-suppressed control plots, but had little effect on longleaf pine basal area. Midstory hardwood reduction methods increased the similarity of the breeding bird species assemblages to those found in the reference plots, compared with the fire-excluded control plots. Species that most strongly contributed to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were, in decreasing order of importance: red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), and brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla). Depending on the similarity index used, additional but weaker contributors to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). Species associated with hardwoods (e.g., tufted titmouse, northern cardinal, Carolina chickadee) contributed to greater similarity of the reference condition by decreasing in abundance after hardwood reduction, whereas open-habitat species increased in numbers, compared with birds on the fire-excluded control plots. Only the detection rates of cardinals and Carolina chickadees were not different among hardwood reduction methods. Two notable species of concern that increased in all hardwood reduction plots compared with the control, but were not strong contributors of the similarity to the reference condition, were northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and southeastern American kestrel (Falco sparverius paulus). Our results suggest that these management methods were beneficial to landbirds characteristic of fire-maintained longleaf pine sandhills in northwest Florida. However, northern bobwhites and Bachman's sparrows may require more intensive management than red-cockaded woodpeckers, such as shorter burn intervals, as these species depend directly on ground cover vegetation. We recommend prescribed spring burning as the most economical and ecologically desirable method for managing breeding bird habitat in longleaf pine sandhill forests."	66	3	641-661		Florida; deforestation; United States; breeding population; avifauna; Aimophila; Aimophila aestiv; Aimophila aestivalis; habi	FL	30.4613878	-86.58853	Conifer	Pinus palustri				CI	N	1994	3	3	18	6	Controlled burn;Herbicide use;Controlled burn;Herbicide use;Girdling	N	N	N	Field observation	A	Birds	N

In this experiment, we compared the abundance, species richness, diversity, and composition of arthropods in 9.3-ha plots in which either (1) all coarse woody debris was removed, (2) a large number oflogs were added, (3) a large number of snags were added, or (4) no coarse woody debris was added or removed. The target taxa were ground-dwelling arthropods, sampled by pitfall traps, and saproxylic beetles (i.e., dependent on dead wood), sampled by flight intercept traps and emergence traps. There were no differences in total ground-dwelling arthropod abundance, richness, diversity, or composition among treatments. Only the results for ground beetles (Carabidae), which were more species rich and diverse in log input plots, supported our prediction that ground-dwelling arthropods would benefit from additions of dead wood. There were also no differences in saproxylic beetle abundance, richness, diversity, or composition among treatments. The findings from this study are encouraging in that arthropods seem less sensitive than expected to manipulations of dead wood in managed pine forests of the southeastern United States. Based on our results, we cannot recommend inputting large amounts of dead wood for conservation purposes, given the expense of such measures. However, the persistence of saproxylic beetles requires that an adequate amount of dead wood is available in the landscape, and we recommend that dead wood be retained whenever possible in managed pine forests."	38	4	1005-1012		North America; biodiversity; Coleoptera; Carabidae; Pinus taeda; United States; Animalia; article; animal; Animals; abundance; beetle; Arthropoda; Beetles; arthropod; Biodiversity; Pinu; coarse woody d; loblolly p; Sout	SC	33.3443889	-81.7433831	Mixed	Pinus taeda	59	arcriculture	"Innumerable studies have since been conducted to better under- stand the environmental impacts of human activities on forest ecosystems.

However, SMZs did provide habitat for an abundant avifauna community including several interior-edge and edge species not found in the pine plantations. Avian abundance was similar among SMZ widths, although densities were highest in the narrow SMZs.

"Area and edge effects on forest songbirds in a non-agricultural upland landscape in Northern Mississippi, USA"	Natural Areas Journal					"We examined area and edge effects on forest songbirds within mature oak (Quercus alba)-pine fragments in Holly Springs National Forest (HSNF), in north-central Mississippi, USA. These fragments were enclosed within a landscape dominated by pine (Pinus taeda and P. echinata) plantations, non-agricultural clearings, and mixed pine-hardwood stands, in stark contrast to oak forests of the agriculture-dominated Midwest. We compared avian community composition in forest fragments of different sizes and in recently clearcut areas adjacent to our forested sites. We also compared Wood Thrush (Catharus mustelinus) nesting success in forest fragments of different sizes and along edge and interior habitats. Forest-obligate species (including Wood Thrush, Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), and Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus)) were associated more commonly, if not exclusively, with forest tracts >55 ha. Nests <150 m from clearcut edges had lower nesting success compared to forest interior habitats and other edge types. The abundance of forest obligates and success of Wood Thrush nests were greater in fragments >55 ha than in smaller fragments. The rate of brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) was extremely low (<1%) compared to other regions in the USA, even though cowbirds were present in adjacent non-forested sites. We conclude that proximity to non-wooded, early successional areas in HSNF significantly influences nest predation in forest fragments. Our results support the theory that area and edge effects on forest songbirds vary according to regional and local landscape factors. We suggest that successful conservation efforts in northern Mississippi require an examination of the specific effects of local management and land use practices within, as well as adjacent to, habitats of concern."	24	4	326-335		border effects clear felling forest fragmentation	MS	34.4256042	-89.444989	Mixed	"Quercus alba, Pinus spp."	60	clearcut	fragments retained adjacent to clearcuts	CI	N	1999	2	2	>90		Clearcutting;Wildlife measures	N	N	N	Field observation	A	Birds	N

The harvest system was comprised of a small feller-buncher and grapple skidders. The stands were allowed to regenerate naturally with no further treatment following the harvests. Pine regeneration was from seeds-in-place and hardwood regeneration primarily from coppice. The area of mineral soil seedbed was greatest after the 2.5-cm harvests and with dormant season harvesting. The combination of mineral soil seedbed area and seed availability by season resulted in varying predominance of pine regeneration.

We used five treatments: control (no removal), clear-cut (100% removal), and 25, 50, and 75% removal of basal area. Territory mapping was used to quantify bird community between mid-April and July of both 2002 and 2003. Microclimate variables were recorded at each plot. The residual basal area and canopy cover showed three distinct conditions after treatment: closed canopy, open forest, and clear-cut. The microclimate varied among treatments: air temperature was highest in clear-cut plots and lowest in control plots, whereas soil moisture had the opposite pattern. A total of 71 bird species were detected, with 36 of them defending territories. Territory density, species richness, and Shannon diversity index differed among the treatments; the relationship between these bird community indices and the level of basal area removal was quadratic, lowest in the clear-cut plots and highest in the intermediate levels. Although species richness was similar among the control, 25, 50, and 75% removal treatments, species composition varied. The richness difference among treatments became smaller in the second year post-treatment (2003) with an increase in bird density and richness occurring in the clear-cut plots."	1		126-129		avian community biodiversity Cumberland Plateau fo	AL	34.94166667	-86.13333333	Mixed	"Quercus spp., Carya spp."				CI	N	2002		2	3	3	Clearcutting;Shelterwood	N	N	N	Spatial analysis	R	Birds	N

Two years after timbering, 30% of the pre-timbering populations remained at the clearcut sites. Jolly-Seber population estimates on one clearcut site decreased from 43 to eight animals after cutting. In contrast, one reference site had a population estimate that oscillated around a mean of 71.

We investigated the importance of CWD to shrew communities in managed upland pine stands in the southeastern United States Coastal Plain. Using a randomized complete block design, 1 of the following treatments was assigned to twelve 9.3-ha plots: removal (n 3; all downed CWD ?10 cm in diameter and ?60 cm long removed), downed (n 3; 5-fold increase in volume of downed CWD), snag (n 3; 10-fold increase in volume of standing dead CWD), and control (n 3; unmanipulated). Shrews (Blarina carolinensis, Sorex longirostris, and Cryptotis parva) were captured over 7 seasons from January 2007 to August 2008 using drift-fence pitfall trapping arrays within treatment plots. Topographic variables were measured and included as treatment covariates. More captures of B. carolinensis were made in the downed treatment compared to removal, and captures of S. longirostris were greater in downed and snag compared to removal. Captures of C. parva did not differ among treatments. Captures of S. longirostris were positively correlated with slope. Our results suggest that abundance of 2 of the 3 common shrew species of the southeastern Coastal Plain examined in our study is influenced by the presence of CWD. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2010 American Society of Mammalogists."	91	4	993-999		Blarina Blarina carolinensis Cryptotis Cryptot Uni	SC	32.0431414	-80.9165463	Mixed	"Pinus taeda, Pinus elliottii, Pinus palustris, Sassafras albidum, Prunus serotina, Lespedeza spp., Rubus spp., Toxicodendron pubescens"	70	reforested agricultural land		CI	N	2007	6	2	9	3	Woody residues removal	N	Y	Y	Trapping	RA	Mammals	Y	Blarina carolinensis	Mammals

Responses of small mammals to coarse woody debris in a southeastern pine forest	Journal of Mammalogy		0022-2372	10.2307/1383293		"The importance of coarse woody debris (CWD) to small mammals in a managed pine (predominantly Pinus palustris, with P. taeda also present throughout) forest in South Carolina was tested experimentally during summer and autumn 1990 and winter and spring 1991-1994. Abundance and demographics of small mammals were compared between plots with abundant CWD created by a tornado (unsalvaged plots) and plots where tornado-created CWD had been removed (salvaged plots). Species composition was similar between unsalvaged and salvaged plots, but more small mammals were captured on unsalvaged plots. Cotton mice (Peromyscus gossypinus) were the most abundant species captured in all plots and were significantly more abundant in unsalvaged plots in every trapping period. Adult female P. gossypinus in unsalvaged plots had greater survival and were more likely to be in reproductive condition than adult females in salvaged plots. Southern short-tailed shrews (Blarina carolinensis) and cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) tended to be more abundant in unsalvaged plots. Fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), the second most abundant species in salvaged plots, were never captured on unsalvaged plots. Large amounts of CWD improve habitat quality of pine forests for P. gossypinus, and CWD is probably an important habitat component for other species."	80	2	460-471		trees; wild animals; woody plants; forests; population dynamics; survival; coniferous forests; small mammals; demography; dead wood; pines; populations; salvage felling and logging; wind damage; trapping	SC	33.5365016	-82.1603415	Conifer	"Pinus palustris, Pinus taeda"	40	regenerating pine stand		CI	N	1990	1	2	2	2	Woody residues removal	N	Y	Y	Trapping	A	Mammals	Y	"Blarina carolinensis, Sigmodon hispidus"	Mammals

Short-term response of breeding birds to oak regeneration treatments in upland hardwood forest	Natural Areas Journal		0885-8608	10.3375/043.034.0403	http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.3375/043.034.0403	"Population declines of several successional-scrub bird species are partly associated with decreased habitat availability as abandoned farmlands return to forest and recently harvested forests regrow. Restoration of mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest is also a concern because of widespread oak regeneration failure, especially on moist, productive sites where competition from faster-growing tree species is fierce following stand-replacing disturbances. Several silvicultural methods are proposed to promote oak regeneration but many are not experimentally tested, especially on productive sites. We surveyed birds in 19 stands to assess response to initial application of three proposed oak regeneration treatments on productive sites: prescribed burning (B); oak shelterwood by midstory herbicide (OSW); shelterwood harvests (SW); and controls (C), for one breeding season before, and two breeding seasons after, implementation. Relative density of successional-scrub species Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), and Chestnut-sided Warblers (Setophaga pensylvanica) increased, while Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) decreased within 11 to 18 months after SW harvests; understory disturbance treatments B or OSW had no effect. Our results indicated that partial harvests created habitat for breeding birds associated with both young and mature forests, whereas understory treatments had little effect. Additionally, we show that even small patches of young forest habitat are used by more individuals and more species of breeding birds than surrounding closed-canopy forest, and may benefit successional-scrub species by enabling their occurrence in an otherwise forested landscape. Absence of several lower-elevation successional-scrub bird species in our mid-elevation SW harvests suggests that comprehensive conservation in the southern Appalachians necessitates creating and maintaining young forest habitats across elevation gradients."	34	4	409-422		habitats; herbicides; wild animals; forests; abandoned land; understorey; regeneration; controlled burning; agricultural land; hardwoods; wild birds; shelterwood system	NC	35.5409899	-83.2815177	Broadleaf	"Carya spp., Liriodendron tulipifera, Oxydendrum arboreum, Cornus florida, Halesia tetraptera, Nyssa sylvatica, Acer rubrum"				BACI	N	2008	2	3	14	5	Controlled burn;Shelterwood;Herbicide use	N	N	N	Transect	RA	Birds	Y	"Black-and-white Warblers, Ovenbird"	Birds

Response of small mammal populations to manipulation of CWD volume was tested in central Appalachian forests in north central West Virginia from 2000-2001. Abundance and diversity of small mammals captured (N=1,564) on 12 experimental 60 X 60 m live-trapping grids were compared. Grids were randomly distributed between addition sites (volume of CWD increased by 50%), removal sites (volume of CWD reduced by 50%), and control sites. We classified grids as edge (<100 m from a forest edge) or interior (greater than or equal to100 m from a forest edge). We captured 15 species in 13,009 trap nights. The most abundant species captured were white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and deer mice (P maniculatus; analyzed together as Peromyscus spp.; 74%), northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda; 12%), and southern red-backed votes (Clethrionomys gapperi; 5%). Diversity estimates were similar among CWD manipulation classes except for average species richness, which was greater in removal sites (x=3.08, SE=0.20) than control sites (x=2.38, SE=0.15) after CWD manipulations (P=0.032). Abundance of small mammals was similar across manipulation classes with the exception of southern red-backed voles, which were most abundant in interior removal sites. These results suggest that manipulation of CWD volume has little short-term effect on abundance, diversity, or condition of small mammals in the central Appalachians."			198-209	Southeastern Association Fish & Wildlife Agencies (Seafwa)	red-backed voles peromyscus-leucopus forest travel	WV	39.4577553	-79.9683381	Mixed	"Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer saccharum, Quercus spp., Carya spp., Robinia pseudoacacia, Prunus serotina;"				CI	N	2000	1	1	8	4	Woody residues removal	N	Y	Y	Live trapping	RA	Mammals	N

Biomass distribution was compared for vines, forbs, grasses, and woody plants. Moderate intensity treatments (chainsaw and shear and chop) consistently ranked highest overall in diversity, while the mature pine/broadleaf forest ranked the lowest.

Short-term effects of silvicultural treatments on microsite heterogeneity and plant diversity in mature Tennessee oak-hickory forests	Northern Journal of Applied Forestry		0742-6348		http://www.ingenta.com/journals/browse/saf/njaf	"Growing emphasis on sustainability has increased the demand for information on effects of forest management on species diversity. We investigated the hypothesis that plant diversity is a function of microsite heterogeneity by documenting plant diversity and heterogeneity in canopy cover, light, and soil moisture produced by four silvicultural treatments during the first growing season following treatment: controlled burning, wildlife retention cut with controlled burning, wildlife retention cut, and shelterwood cutting. The study was conducted on the Chuck Swan State Forest and Wildlife Management Area in eastern Tennessee, USA. Treatments and controls were randomly assigned within four relatively undisturbed, 70- to 90-year-old oak-hickory stands. Heterogeneity in canopy cover and photosynthetically active radiation was greatest after shelterwood cutting, whereas the wildlife retention cut resulted in less removal of canopy trees and a smaller increase in heterogeneity of these factors. The addition of controlled burning enhanced the effects of the wildlife retention cut. Controlled burning alone had the least impact on heterogeneity of these factors. Soil moisture variability appeared to be independent of treatments. Shelterwood cutting increased first-year herbaceous plant diversity, and this increase was likely due, in part, to increased heterogeneity in canopy cover, light, and seedbed condition. These first-year results partially support the hypothesis that plant diversity is a function of microsite diversity in these forests. Long-term monitoring is underway."	23	3	197-203		soil types; species diversity; soil water content; canopy; light relations; forest soils; silviculture; controlled burning; silvicultural systems; solar radiation; wildlife management; wildlife conservation; shelterwood system	TN	36.3714444	-83.8884014	Mixed	"Quercus alba, Quercus montana, Quercus velutina, Quercus coccinea, Nyssa sylvatica, Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, Pinus taeda, Pinus strobus, Oxydendrum arboreum"	50			BACI	N	2000	1	1	10	2	Controlled burn;Shelterwood;Selection system;Wildlife measures	N	N	N	Field observation;Transect	A	Vascular plants	N

Based on their methods, the Flat Creek watershed, a low-gradient, forest-dominated watershed located in northern Louisiana, was included on the 303(d) list as impaired due to low dissolved oxygen (DO). Macroinvertebrate sampling may create a surrogate for these physicochemical parameters to appropriately address natural conditions and anthropogenic stresses, or this study, macroinvertebrate samples were collected at 11 stream locations five times; spring of 2006, and 2008, and late summer 2006,2007, and 2008. During the fall of 2007, trees were removed on both sides of three 1st-order streams. This study investigates how macroinvertebrate communities respond to timber harvest in a low-gradient watershed. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to determine (1) if timber harvest exacerbates low DO levels, (2) if there are any effects on the macroinvertebrate community structures, and (3) if biocriteria could be utilized for credible total maximum daily load (TMDL) development. Monthly water quality measurements including stream temperature and DO were taken from 2006 and continued following timber harvest through the present. Nine of the eleven sites decreased in monthly DO concentrations after harvest. Results also indicate that a change was evident in DO sensitive communities in the confluence of some of the harvested sites, but not in the immediate harvested plot areas. Macroinvertebrate communities may provide understanding to short term anthropogenic nonpoint disturbance to determine TMDL improvements. Continued monitoring is essential to understanding natural conditions and the impact of the timber harvest."			193-200		Dissolution; Benthic macroinvertebrates dissolved oxygen; Biochemical oxygen demand; Dissolved; EPT; Rivers	LA	30.8769413	-92.4340421	Conifer	Pinus taeda				BACI	N	2006	2	2	11	11	Clearcutting	N	N	N	Habitat characterization	RA	Invertebrates (aquatic)	Y	"Dipterans, Chironomidae, Ceratopogonidae, Chaoboridae, Asellidae, Sphaeriidae"	Invertebrates (aquatic)

Arthropod abundance and biomass did not differ between unconverted logging roads traversing mature hardwoods and those passing through clearcuts.

The study area is in the Wine Spring Creek watershed on the Nantahala National Forest of the Southern Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina. The regeneration treatments were: an irregular, two-aged shelterwood cut (2A), with 5.0 m 2/ha residual basal area; a shelterwood cut (SW), with 9.0 m 2/ha residual basal area; a group selection cut (GS), with 0.10-0.20 ha openings and 25% overstory removal on area basis at first entry; fourth, the control, consisted of two uncut sites (UC). Each harvest treatment was replicated three times across the landscape in similar plant community types. Within each treatment area, permanent plots were marked and inventoried for overstory, midstory, and herbaceous layer plants. In each permanent plot, we collected soil samples in winter (December-March) to reduce temporal variation due to vegetation phenological stage and rainfall events. We analyzed soil samples for extractable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, bulk density, A-horizon depth, total carbon (C), and nitrogen (N). Species diversity of overstory, understory, and herbaceous layer species was evaluated using species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener's index of diversity (H?), and Pielou's evenness index (E). We used direct gradient analysis (non-metric multidimensional scaling, NMS) to explore the changes in vegetation-site relationships among herbaceous layer abundance, and soil characteristics and overstory basal area between pre-harvest (1994) and post-harvest (2000). Twelve minor overstory species were cut from the 2A treatments and nine species were cut from the SW treatments. Thus, it is not surprising that S and H? were reduced in the overstory on the heavily cut sites. However, most of these species sprouted from cut stumps and were substantially more abundant in the midstory layer after harvest than before. For the midstory, we found higher S and H? on the harvested treatments than the control; however, H? did not differ significantly among the harvest treatments. We measured an increase in herbaceous layer H? on the more heavily cut treatments (2A and SW) after harvest. We found an increase in average distance in the NMS ordination among sites in 2000 compared to 1994, which suggests greater herbaceous species diversity after harvest. However, we did not see a clear separation among harvest treatments in the NMS ordination. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Forest removal is a particularly significant threat because an estimated 82% of amphibians rely on forests for part of their lives. Biphasic amphibians rely on suitable terrestrial habitat to support their post-metamorphic growth and survival and also to maintain appropriate habitat and landscape connectivity. We created 4 replicate, 16-ha experimental arrays in the southeastern USA to examine the effects of forest removal on migratory movements of adult biphasic amphibians. Each array contained four forest-harvesting treatments that included an unharvested control, a partially harvested stand, a clearcut with coarse woody debris retained, and a clearcut with coarse woody debris removed. Some amphibian species emigrated from wetlands in significantly greater numbers through forest controls compared with harvested treatments. Also, salamanders were generally more sensitive to forest removal than were frogs, with a significantly greater proportion of salamanders migrating through forested habitat compared to frogs. For several species, individuals were significantly more likely to avoid clearcuts when emigrating compared to immigrating. Individuals that emigrated into clearcut treatments were more likely to reverse direction and return to wetlands in some species. Synthesis and applications. Our study identifies one mechanism by which forest removal shapes the abundance and distribution of amphibians in terrestrial habitat. To promote the persistence of amphibian populations, conservation efforts should focus on preserving forest habitat adjacent to reproduction sites. Such measures are especially important where forest habitat connects local populations or where it links reproduction sites to other habitat features necessary for amphibian growth, survival, or overwintering."	46	3	554-561		Ambystoma Bufo clearcutting forestry habitat loss	SC	32.0377115	-80.8676199	Conifer	"Pinus taeda, Quercus spp., Acer rubrum, Carya spp., Cornus florida, Liquidambar styraciflua"				CI	N	2004	3	4	12	4	Woody residues removal;Thinning;Clearcutting	N	Y	N	Trapping	RA	Amphibians	N

Masked shrew relative abundance was greater post-harvest in 2-aged harvest stands than in group selection harvest stands or uncut stands, For masked shrews, these high elevation, 2-aged harvests may have provided an optimal mix of residual overstory shading, dense shrub-layer shading from new regeneration, and abundant downed coarse woody debris.

We studied breeding bird communities in selectively harvested bottomland forests in northeastern Louisiana during 2003-2004. We conducted point counts in recently harvested stands (1-5 yr postharvest) and older harvests (1218 yr postharvest); we paired each with a reference stand that had not been harvested for > 30 years. Of 35 species with sufficient detections for analysis, we found evidence that abundances of 17 species differed among treatments. Three species were sensitive to creation of canopy openings by timber harvests, including 2 species of concern in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, USA, prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea) and Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens). However, 4 species of concern often associated with densely vegetated canopy gaps were more abundant in older harvests than in reference stands: Swainson's warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii), hooded warbler (Wilsonia citrina), white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus), and Kentucky warbler (Oporomis formosus). As expected, a suite of species typically associated with shrub and forest-edge habitats was more abundant in recent harvests than in reference stands. We conclude that selective logging has a strong influence on bird abundances in both recent and older harvests in bottomland forests. With the exception of Acadian flycatcher, older harvests and reference stands supported similar abundances of the species typically found in closed-canopy bottomland forests. In addition, older harvests supported substantially higher abundances of gap-dependent species than other treatments. Our results should be useful to land managers and conservation planners evaluating short- and long-term effects of timber management practices on breeding birds in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.

Response of beetles (Coleoptera) to repeated applications of prescribed fire and other fuel reduction techniques in the southern Appalachian Mountains	Forest Ecology and Management					"Coleoptera are important components of forest ecosystems and can be affected by forest management schemes aimed at limiting fuel build-up. Our research objective was to determine if repeated applications of fuel reduction treatments resulted in changes in abundance or diversity of beetle (Coleoptera) families, genera, and species within upland mixed hardwood forests in the southern Appalachians Mountains, North Carolina, USA. We established three replicate blocks (‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬¢‚àö√Ñ‚àö√∫¬¨¬®¬¨‚à´56 ha) and split each block into four fuel reduction treatments. Treatments included prescribed burning, mechanical felling, a combination of prescribed burning and mechanical felling, and a control (i.e., no fuel reduction techniques applied). We implemented treatments multiple times (2 mechanical thinnings and 4 prescribed burns) over the course of a 15-year period. Using pitfall and colored pan traps, we captured 7037 coleopterans comprised of 62 families over a three-year period. Total coleopteran abundance and diversity were similar across all treatments; however, some beetle families, genera, and species responded to treatments. Nitidulidae were significantly more abundant within controls compared to all other treatments in 2015, whereas Mordellidae generally had higher abundances in mechanical and burns compared to mechanical in 2015 and mechanical and controls in 2016. Chrysomelidae was significantly more abundant in mechanical and burns compared to all other treatments over the entire duration of the study. However, Staphylinidae abundance was significantly lower in mechanical and burns compared to the other treatments. Numerous genera and species also showed variable treatment-level responses. Burn treatments killed some mature trees and reduced forest canopy cover, resulting in higher light availability and thereby greater herbaceous cover and diversity on the forest floor. This vegetation in the understory of burned treatment units may be partially responsible for many of the treatment-level responses of beetle taxa we documented.

Response of beetles (Coleoptera) to repeated applications of prescribed fire and other fuel reduction techniques in the southern Appalachian Mountains	Forest Ecology and Management					"Coleoptera are important components of forest ecosystems and can be affected by forest management schemes aimed at limiting fuel build-up. Our research objective was to determine if repeated applications of fuel reduction treatments resulted in changes in abundance or diversity of beetle (Coleoptera) families, genera, and species within upland mixed hardwood forests in the southern Appalachians Mountains, North Carolina, USA. We established three replicate blocks (‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬¢‚àö√Ñ‚àö√∫¬¨¬®¬¨‚à´56 ha) and split each block into four fuel reduction treatments. Treatments included prescribed burning, mechanical felling, a combination of prescribed burning and mechanical felling, and a control (i.e., no fuel reduction techniques applied). We implemented treatments multiple times (2 mechanical thinnings and 4 prescribed burns) over the course of a 15-year period. Using pitfall and colored pan traps, we captured 7037 coleopterans comprised of 62 families over a three-year period. Total coleopteran abundance and diversity were similar across all treatments; however, some beetle families, genera, and species responded to treatments. Nitidulidae were significantly more abundant within controls compared to all other treatments in 2015, whereas Mordellidae generally had higher abundances in mechanical and burns compared to mechanical in 2015 and mechanical and controls in 2016. Chrysomelidae was significantly more abundant in mechanical and burns compared to all other treatments over the entire duration of the study. However, Staphylinidae abundance was significantly lower in mechanical and burns compared to the other treatments. Numerous genera and species also showed variable treatment-level responses. Burn treatments killed some mature trees and reduced forest canopy cover, resulting in higher light availability and thereby greater herbaceous cover and diversity on the forest floor. This vegetation in the understory of burned treatment units may be partially responsible for many of the treatment-level responses of beetle taxa we documented. This study took place after several rounds of fuel reduction techniques were applied over a 15 year period. Some beetle abundance responses were immediate; whereas other groups seemed to be influenced by the application of treatments over time, highlighting the need to examine long-term responses to forest management practices. ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√°¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V."	429		294-299		Appalachian Mountains; Appalachians; Beetles; Chrysomelidae; Coleoptera; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fuel reduction; Fuels; Hardwoods; Insects; Landforms; Mechanical thinning; Mordellidae; Nitidulidae; North Carolina; Prescribed fire; Prescribed fires; Staphylinidae; United States; abundance estimation; beetle; forest ecosystem; forest management; fuel; mechanical control; mixed forest; prescribed burning; species diversity; thinning; vegetation cover	NC	35.26166667	-82.29083333	Mixed	"Quercus spp., Carya spp., Pinus spp."	125		"Prior to the 2003 prescribed burns conducted in this study, none of the study sites had been thinned or burned for a minimum of 20 years"	CI	N	2014	11	3	3	3	Controlled burn;Mechanical felling	N	N	N	Trapping	RA	Invertebrates (land)	Y	"Nitidulidae, Staphylinidae"	Invertebrates (land)

Effects of gap-based silviculture on thermal biology of a terrestrial reptile	Wildlife Research	1035-3712			http://www.publish.csiro.au/wr	"Context. Terrestrial reptiles require varied thermal environments to promote optimal physiological performance, growth, reproduction, and survival. Aims. Our study was designed to determine whether gap-based silvicultural practices offer suitable thermal environments for eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) by examining environmental temperature variation and body temperature of eastern box turtles in, and adjacent to, canopy gaps. Methods. We recorded box turtle body temperature from 20 radio-tracked turtles and environmental temperatures (canopy gaps and undisturbed habitat) using temperature loggers from June to September 2014 in a managed forest after canopy gaps (0.28-1.13 ha gap-1) were created via gap-based silviculture. Key results. Over the four-month study period, gap temperatures were generally higher than adjacent undisturbed microhabitats. Box turtle body temperatures were closely correlated with environmental temperatures in undisturbed habitat in June and July. Turtle body temperatures were, however, closely correlated with environmental temperatures in canopy gaps in August and September. In addition, box turtles in our study had activity areas that overlapped canopy gaps from 0 to 65%, depending on the individual. As percentage overlap of canopy gaps increased, turtle body temperatures were increasingly correlated with canopy gap temperatures. Furthermore, as percentage overlap of canopy gaps increased, daily mean body temperature records consistently stayed within the preferred box turtle body temperature range (20.2-26.2 degrees C). Conclusions. Our study suggests that gap-based silviculture can create thermally compatible environments for box turtles depending on the time of day and year, and that box turtles use these microhabitats to thermoregulate. Implications. The application of relatively small-scale silvicultural practices (<=1 ha gap-1) that provide heterogeneity in forest structure, composition, and function may be a useful alternative to clearcutting and other intensive harvesting methods that are associated with declines in terrestrial reptile populations."	45	1	72-81		body temperature; canopy gaps; clear felling; environmental temperature; forests; microhabitats; silviculture; stand characteristics; stand structure; telemetry; thermoregulation	KY	37.32	-84.14	Mixed	"Quercus alba, Q. coccinea, Q. montana, Q. velutina, Carya glabra, C. ovata, Pinus echinata, P. virginiana."	111	timber harvest	"The BCF (37 320 N, 84 140 W) is managed by Berea College and is used for experimental research studies, timber harvesting, recreation, and education."

Relationships between white-footed mice and logging residue: informing the sustainability of potential wood bioenergy harvests	Forest Ecology and Management	0378-1127		http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117706		"We examined local and site-scale relationships between white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and logging residue after timber harvests to assess potential effects of expanding bioenergy markets in the southern Appalachian region of the United States. We sampled mice in 10 recent (2013-2015) clearcut or shelterwood harvests dominated either by white pine or hardwoods prior to harvest. We captured mice May-August, 2016 and 2017 using 10 grids of 60 Sherman traps spaced 15 m apart and set twice for five consecutive nights in each year. We categorized traps as either near (<=5 m) or far (>5 m) from coarse woody debris (CWD; woody debris >=10 cm in diameter). We estimated site-level woody debris volumes using modified prism sweep sampling and determined vegetation, woody debris, and ground cover composition at each trap location. White-footed mouse occupancy increased with greater trap-level CWD cover in all stands, and greater site-level woody debris volume in white pine stands. Mouse abundance increased with greater site-level woody debris volume, and abundance was greater at white pine sites than hardwood sites. These results demonstrate that residual logging debris is important to white-footed mice, both at the local- and site-scale. Reductions in residual logging debris following harvests, including via removal of low value stems for wood bioenergy, likely will result in decreased white-footed mouse occupancy and abundance. We recommend developing proactive strategies to retain scattered logging residues following even-aged timber harvests, especially in cases where bioenergy harvests occur in the southern Appalachian region."	457		117706		bioenergy; clear felling; coniferous forests; effects; forest litter; forests; ground cover; hardwoods; litter (plant); logging; markets; pines; relationships; renewable energy; residues; shelterwood system; slash; small mammals; sustainability; traps; wood	NC	35.043498	-83.097855	Conifer	"Pinus strobus, P. echinata"		timber harvest	"The PNF sites were harvested using a 2-aged regeneration method, leaving a basal area averaging 4.98 m2 ha‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚â†1"	CI	N	2016	1	2	10	2	Clearcutting;Shelterwood	N	N	N	Trapping	RA	Mammals	N

Ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) response to harvest residue retention: implications for sustainable forest bioenergy production	Forests	1999-4907		http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f11010048		"Research Highlights: Our study adds to the scant literature on the effects of forest bioenergy on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and contributes new insights into the responses of ground beetle species and functional groups to operational harvest residue retention. We discovered that count of Harpalus pensylvanicus (DeGeer) - a habitat generalist - increased owing to clear-cut harvests but decreased due to harvest residue reductions; these observations uniquely allowed us to separate effects of additive forest disturbances to demonstrate that, contrarily to predictions, a generalist species considered to be adapted to disturbance may be negatively affected by altered habitat elements associated with disturbances from renewable energy development. Background and Objectives: Despite the potential environmental benefits of forest bioenergy, woody biomass harvests raise forest sustainability concerns for some stakeholders. Ground beetles are well established ecological indicators of forest ecosystem health and their life history characteristics are connected to habitat elements that are altered by forest harvesting. Thus, we evaluated the effects of harvest residue retention following woody biomass harvest for forest bioenergy on ground beetles in an operational field experiment. Materials and Methods: We sampled ground beetles using pitfall traps in harvest residue removal treatments representing variable woody biomass retention prescriptions, ranging from no retention to complete retention of all merchantable woody biomass. We replicated treatments in eight clear-cut stands in intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forests in North Carolina and Georgia. Results: Harvest residue retention had no effect on ground beetle richness and diversity. However, counts of H. pensylvanicus, Anisodactylus spp., and ""burrower"" and ""fast runner"" functional groups, among others, were greater in treatments with no woody biomass harvest than those with no harvest residue retention; all of these ground beetles may confer ecosystem services in forests. We suggest that H. pensylvanicus is a useful indicator species for burrowing and granivorous ground beetle response to harvest residue reductions in recently harvested stands. Lastly, we propose that retaining 15% retention of total harvest residues or more, depending on regional and operational variables, may support beneficial ground beetle populations."	11	1	48		adverse effects; bioenergy; biological indicators; biomass; clear felling; ecology; ecosystem services; ecosystems; effects; energy sources; environmental assessment; environmental factors; field experimentation; field tests; forest litter; forest management; forest products; forests; harvesting; health; indicator species; indicators; life history; literature; litter (plant); pines; pitfall traps; plant residues; renewable energy; residues; silvicultural systems; stakeholders; sustainability; traps	NC	35.472451	-76.872919	Mixed	"Pinus taeda, Acer rubrum, Liquidambar styraciflua"		plantation	"Prior to harvest, the blocks were comprised of a planted loblolly pine (P. taeda) overstory and a hardwood midstory (e.g., red maple (Acer rubrum L.), American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.)).

Influence of riparian buffers and habitat characteristics on salamander assemblages in headwater streams within managed forests	Forest Ecology and Management	0378-1127		http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.006	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112718312131	"Streamside management zones (SMZs), buffers of forest retained along streams when adjacent areas are harvested, are a primary tool for maintaining ecological functions in managed forests. However, few studies have examined the influence of SMZs on salamanders, and none have examined variation in salamander occupancy, species richness, and abundance across a gradient of SMZ widths at a large spatial scale. Further, because previous studies had limited ability to detect responses of uncommon species, little is known about interspecific variation in salamander responses or whether SMZs serve as refuges for terrestrial species during harvesting. To evaluate the role of SMZs in maintaining salamander species, we conducted four replicate surveys at 102 headwater stream sites, spanning a gradient of SMZ widths and adjacent forest stand ages, within the Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas, USA. We used a hierarchical Bayesian community occupancy model to estimate salamander species richness and species-specific occupancy responses to SMZ and overstory characteristics, while accounting for variation in occupancy and detection attributable to site and sampling covariates. Additionally, we used Bayesian binomial mixture models to examine the influence of SMZ width and surrounding stand age on abundance of two stream-associated salamanders [Ouachita dusky salamander (Desmognathus brimleyorum) and many-ribbed salamander (Eurycea multiplicata)] and three terrestrial salamanders [red-backed salamander (Plethodon serratus), slimy salamander (P. glutinosus complex), and Caddo Mountain salamander (P. caddoensis)]. Occupancy, species richness, and abundance increased with increasing SMZ width, but the strength of responses varied among species. Occupancy of uncommon species was highest at sites with wide SMZs, likely because of the need for specific habitat elements (e.g., wetlands, rocky talus). Richness was lowest in SMZs dominated by pine overstory, and lowest in mid-aged stands, consistent with a lagged decrease in richness within SMZs following harvest. Finally, we documented patterns of abundance consistent with the evacuation hypothesis, indicating that salamanders may leave recently harvested areas seeking more suitable habitat and microclimate within SMZs. Collectively, results indicate that SMZs in intensively managed forests can support robust salamander communities, provided managers continue to retain wide SMZs at some key sites across the landscape (i.e., >=55 m on each side of the stream), a value larger than current Forestry BMP guidelines."	432		868-883		communities; ecology; effects; forestry; forests; guidelines; harvesting; microclimate; models; mountains; silvicultural systems; species richness; stand age; streams; surveys; wetlands	AK	34.503928	-94.452939	Conifer	Pinus taeda	35	timber harvest		CI	N	2014	2	2	4	1	Clearcutting;Thinning	N	N	N	Field observation;Trapping	RA	Fish & Aquatic vertebrates	N

However, consequences of eucalyptus plantations for fauna in the southeastern United States have not been investigated. In this study, we compared terrestrial and arboreal arthropod abundance, biomass, family richness, and diversity over 2 years between newly established Camden white gum (Eucalyptus benthamii) plantations and young slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations of similar age (1-2 years old) and older age (6-7 years old), but similar height. Overall, arthropod family richness, biodiversity, biomass, and terrestrial arthropod abundance were similar for eucalyptus and slash pine stands of both age classes. Arboreal arthropods were least abundant in young eucalyptus stands. Terrestrial arthropod abundance decreased 78% from 2014 to 2015, likely due to annual variation in weather. The similarity in arthropod communities between eucalyptus and slash pine plantations suggests that insectivorous fauna such as breeding birds may be able to feed effectively within young eucalyptus plantations.

Active management of forests benefit the Cerulean Warbler by creating the complex structural conditions preferred by the species, but further research is needed to determine optimal silvicultural strategies. We quantified and compared the broad-scale influence of timber harvests within central Appalachian hardwood forests on estimated abundance and territory density of Cerulean Warblers. We conducted point counts at seven study areas across three states within the central Appalachian region (West Virginia [n=4], Kentucky [n=1], Virginia [n=2]) and territory mapping at two of the study areas in West Virginia, pre- and post-harvest, for up to five breeding seasons from 2013 to 2017. Our primary objective was to relate change in abundance to topographic and vegetation metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of current Cerulean Warbler habitat management guidelines. We used single-species hierarchical (N-mixture) models to estimate abundance while accounting for detection biases. Pre-harvest mean basal area among study areas was 29.3 m2/ha. Harvesting reduced mean basal area among study areas by 40% (mean 17.2 m2/ha) at harvest interior and harvest edge points. Territory density increased 100% (P=0.003) from pre-harvest to two years post-harvest. Cerulean Warbler abundance increased with increasing percentage of basal area that comprised tree species preferred for foraging and nesting (i.e., white oak species, sugar maple [Acer saccharum], hickories) or of large diameter trees (>=40.6 cm diameter at breast height). Positive population growth was predicted to occur where these vegetation metrics were >50% of residual basal area. Post-harvest abundance at harvest interior points was greater than at reference points and when accounting for years-post-harvest in modeling abundance, Cerulean Warbler abundance increased at harvest interior and reference points two years post-harvest and subsequently decreased three years post-harvest. Modeled abundance remained the same at harvest edge points. Increases in abundance and territory density were greater in stands with low pre-harvest densities (<2 birds/point or <0.40 territory/ha) of Cerulean Warblers, whereas populations within stands with higher densities pre-harvest had minimal changes in abundance and territory density. Overall, our results indicate that harvests based on the Cerulean Warbler Management Guidelines for Enhancing Breeding Habitat in Appalachian Hardwood Forests, at all available slope positions and aspects where pre-harvest densities are <0.40 territory/ha, may provide breeding habitat for Cerulean Warblers for at least two years post-harvest in the central Appalachian region."	448		409-423		conservation; ecological disturbance; ecology; effects; efficacy; foraging; forest management; forests; guidelines; habitat management; habitats; hardwoods; harvesting; models; population growth; silviculture; trees; woody plants	KY	38.191258	-83.009258	Broadleaf	"Quercus rubra, Q. coccinea, Q. velutina, Q. alba, Q. montanus, A. rubrum, Prunus serotina, Lirodendron tulipifera"		timber harvest		CI	N	2013	4	3	1	1	Clearcutting;Woody residues removal	N	N	N	Field observation	A	Trees	N

Fire is a common and widespread disturbance process that has the potential to affect animal movements through modifications to the environment. Using radiotelemetry, we examined the contribution of these factors to variation in movements and home range over a 5-year period in a forest-dwelling terrestrial turtle, Terrapene carolina, at fire-maintained and unburned habitats in the southeastern United States. Female turtles had annual home-range sizes twice as large as males and moved longer distances per day during the nesting season (June and July), but males exhibited greater spatial fidelity from year to year. Turtles at the unburned site had home-range sizes twice as large as those at the fire-maintained site, and home-range size also decreased with increasing frequency and extent of fire, but this latter effect was strongest in females. Home-range behavior was highly repeatable within individuals of both sexes over time. This is the first evidence that fire influences the spatial ecology and movements of turtles, most likely through fire's impact on the spatial configuration, availability and quality of critical resources. That individuals behaved consistently through time, but differently from one another according to both intrinsic individual attributes and extrinsic environmental factors provides strong evidence of consistent inter- and intra-population variation in space use and movement behaviors in T. carolina.
