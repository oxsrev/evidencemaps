Adoption and diffusion of renewable energy - The case of biogas as alternative fuel for cooking in Pakistan	Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews	1364-0321	10.1016/j.rser.2018.10.011	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032118307111?via%3Dihub	"Alternative energy technologies such as biogas are being promoted, but despite the significant potential and efforts to implement these technologies, only small numbers of households have succeeded in the transition towards these alternative energy sources. Moreover, sustainability and the functionality of alternative energy technologies remain unknown. The study aims to explore the socioeconomic constraints in the adoption and diffusion of biogas as alternative fuel for cooking in households in rural Pakistan and access the impact of biogas technology adoption on income, crop productivity and fuel consumption and drudgery. The study has also scrutinized the factors affecting the continuity of the biogas plants. Our analysis adds to the limited literature of adoption of biogas and the transition towards alternative fuel sources in the Global South. A multistage sampling procedure was used to collect data from 630 biogas adopters and non-adopters from three districts of Punjab. The empirical results from logit model and propensity score matching approach indicate that the older, wealthy farmers are more likely to adopt biogas technology. Cook's education, structure of house, location of kitchen and access to credit institutions also play positive role in this process. Poor operational methods, lack of maintenance and training facilities were the main reasons for the functional failure of existing plants and reason for the discontinuation. Moreover, biogas adoption has positive and significant impact on income and crop revenues and has negative impact on fuelwood expenditures and collection time. Due to the multidimensional nature of the problem, a comprehensive remedial approach addressing the socio-technical factors identified in the study and considering all stakeholders' cooperation could solve the existing lock-in situation in the ongoing implementation of biogas production and the transition towards alternative fuel sources."	101		255-264	Energy transition; Adoption; Biogas; Impact assessment; Pakistan; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; HOUSEHOLD BIOGAS; RURAL HOUSEHOLDS; IMPACT; CROP; DETERMINANT; BARRIERS; TIGRAY; HEALTH; FUTURE	The study aims to explore the socioeconomic constraints in the adoption and diffusion of biogas as alternative fuel for cooking in households in rural Pakistan.

Although each case must be considered independently, given a reliable fuel source, renewable energy mini-grids powered by biomass gasifiers or micro-hydro plants appear to be the favoured option due to their lower levelised costs, provision of AC power, potential to provide a 24 h service and ability to host larger capacity systems that can power a wide range of electricity uses. Sustainability indicators are applied to three case studies in order to explore the extent to which sustainable welfare benefits can be created by renewable energy mini-grids. Policy work should focus on raising awareness about renewable energy mini-grids, improving institutional, technical and regulatory frameworks and developing innovative financing mechanisms to encourage private sector investments.

This could have the twin benefits of reduced impacts on human health and deforestation. The aim of this study is to better understand the barriers to the uptake of ethanol stove technologies by eliciting users' perception, adoption, and use patterns of ethanol stoves. The study was undertaken in Maputo, a city that was the focus of the first large-scale commercial ethanol stove project in Africa. A mixed-methods approach was adopted using both quantitative (N = 341 household interviews) and qualitative methods (5 focus group discussions, expert interviews). Ethanol stoves are currently used by about 17% of the surveyed households, while approximately 12% had discontinued its use and 71% never used it. While a large proportion of ethanol users compared the stove favourably against charcoal in terms of cooking time, convenience, cleanliness, and easiness to use, ethanol use seems to have diminished compared to charcoal. Ethanol seems to have replaced other clean cooking technologies such as electricity or LPG rather than charcoal. High ethanol fuel prices combined with low fuel quality and accessibility, as well as stove malfunctions due to poor design influenced many ethanol stove adopters to quit it. For the effective uptake of ethanol, it will be necessary to address the factors that tend to discourage its use, particularly its high initial and operational cost, poor fuel quality, unreliable fuel supply, and poor stove design. Although clean cooking fuels might not be attractive to users due to affordability and failure to meet user preferences, awareness raising campaigns that target potential users should emphasise the associated health and safety benefits of clean cooking fuels. ¬© 2018 International Energy Initiative"	44		97-108	Cookstove; Cookstove Adoption; Ethanol; Mozambique; Charcoal; Deforestation; Ethanol fuels; Cooking technology; Low fuel qualities; Qualitative method; Sub-saharan africa; Users' perception; Stoves; cooking appliance; fuel consumption; perception; technology adoption; Maputo [Maputo (PRV)]; Maputo [Mozambique]	"The aim of this study is to better understand the barriers to the uptake of ethanol stove technologies by eliciting users' perception, adoption, and use patterns of ethanol stoves."

Although now largely discredited, this assumption remains a foundation of laissez-faire policies that anticipate energy transition resulting spontaneous forest recovery with economic development. Our results suggest that such policies can undermine broader policy objectives and actually worsen forest conditions in rural Indonesia. Based on a case study of forest margin communities in eastern Indonesia, we demonstrate that fuel subsidy reform did little to reduce rural household demand for fuelwood, while dramatically increasing fuelwood demand for processing agricultural products. Our results show how household decisions related to fuel sources are affected by non-economic considerations and external factors, such as opportunities to sell fuelwood. We argue that policy interventions that encourage energy transition of households do not necessarily improve forest conditions, as household fuelwood use may be a symptom, rather than a driver of deforestation and forest degradation. Thus policies to improve forest conditions should focus more on addressing the market environment of forest-margin communities, providing energy alternatives to small industries that are often the larger consumers of fuelwood.

The results indicate an adoption rate of 70% and identify the characteristics of the stoves that contribute to their adoption and sustained use."	27	1	26-36	cooking; development projects; innovation adoption; project appraisal; rural areas; stoves	Assess the adoption of the Proworld Cookstove	Peru	Cuzco	-13.53	-71.97	Urban and Rural	Households	130	43	Assess the adoption of the Proworld Cookstove			NR	Proworld Service Corps	2007	2015	Cooking	Cookstove	Improved cookstove	Survey	"A household survey was utilised to determine the factors that contribute to the adoption and sustained use of the Proworld improved stove. According to staff, the improved stove has a lifespan of five years. We gathered data from the three communities where Cal Poly students had installed stoves during the past four programme years, 2011–14, noting that students worked in community 1 in two separate years. Data on the adoption rate were gathered from 43 households in the three study communities. However, the complete survey was administered to only 41 households because two of the non-adopters refused to participate in the survey. Nevertheless, we still included them in the adoption data to accurately reflect the non-adoption rate. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained through a combination of objective and open-ended questions. The survey questions were categorised into six sections that addressed stove use, mechanical issues, cultural issues, fuels and other stove devices, interviewee perceptions related to the benefits of improved stoves, and household demographics. The study also included observations and conclusions recorded in a field journal based on visual inspections of stoves, houses, and the communities. Additional information was gathered through interviews with Proworld field staff. The field team consisted of a Cal Poly faculty leader, two undergraduate research assistants, and two Quechua-speaking Proworld extensionists"	2015	4	4	70	Y	Convenience+; Time Saving+	Cost Saving+			"The stove must be able to cook all or most of the foods that people want to cook, in the quantity they need, to a similar taste, and with the pots and utensils that they normally use. If people have to change what they cook or the way they cook in order to use a new stove, they are not likely to adopt it as their primary cooking device."

Meeting this objective requires knowledge about determinants of adoption, particularly in rural areas where the cost of traditional cooking technologies and fuels are non-monetary, and where people have limited capacity to purchase an ICS. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with 383 households in rural Malawi asking them if they would chose a locally made ICS or a package of sugar and salt of roughly equal value. Six months later, we assessed adoption and stove use patterns. Sixty-six percent of households chose the ICS. We find that having a larger share of crop residues in household fuel supply, awareness of the environmental impacts of woodfuel reliance, time the primary cook devotes to collecting fuelwood, and peer effects at the village-level increase the odds of choosing the ICS. Having a large labor supply for fuelwood collection and experience with a non-traditional cooking technology decreased the odds of choosing the ICS. In a rapid assessment six months after stoves were distributed, we found 80% of households were still using the ICS, but not exclusively. Our findings suggest considerable potential for wide-scale adoption of low cost ICS in Malawi."	92		409-419	Adoption; Biomass; Cookstoves; Fuelwood; Malawi; Sub-Saharan Africa	Assessment of adoption and stove use patterns following a discrete choice experiment of either improved cookstove or equivalent value package	Malawi	Kasungu; Machinga	-13.04;-15.17	33.45;35.29	Rural	Households	383	121	This paper focuses on willingness to adopt improved cookstoves (ICS) in Malawi where household air pollution from traditional cooking is the most important risk factor for burden of disease	NR	"This paper focuses on willingness to adopt improved cookstoves (ICS) in Malawi where household air pollution from traditional cooking is the most important risk factor for burden of disease (IHME, 2013), and regional climate change is a pressing issue"	"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Fogarty International Center and National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute"	Malawi Forests and Livelihoods Survey	2013	2013	Cooking	NR	Improved cookstove	Survey	"For our study we defined a household as a group of people that regularly eat together.

Our household survey was designed to mirror prior waves of the MFLS, but also to include new modules focused on household energy and cooking. The survey was administered by a team of skilled enumerators that underwent 10 days of classroom training followed by a 3 day pre-test outside of the study districts. For each household selected we also conducted a separate interview with the primary cook. Primary cooks were defined as those who cooked more than 50% of the meals in the household during the past 30 days. The primary cook survey includes modules on cook demographics, frequency and seasonality of cooking practices, household food consumption, kitchen design and ventilation, fuel use, cooking technology choices, other environmental exposures, awareness about the health, environmental and air pollution implications of cooking choices (i.e., have households been informed by forest officials, NGOs, schools etc. that reliance on fuelwood and charcoal has negative consequences), perceptions of attributes of traditional stoves vs. improved stoves, and indicators of health status of the cook and children under five.

Despite the promise of improved cookstoves to reduce these impacts, adoption rates are relatively low. Using a 2-wave sample of 144 households from the baseline and first midline of an ongoing 4-year randomized controlled trial in Rwanda, we analyze the drivers and associations of early adoption of a household energy intervention marketed by a private sector firm. Households sign an annual contract to purchase sustainably produced biomass pellets and lease a fan micro-gasification cookstove with verified emissions reductions in laboratory settings. Using difference-in-differences and fixed effects estimation techniques, we examine the association between take-up of the improved cooking system and household fuel expenditures, health outcomes, and time use for primary cooks. Thirty percent of households adopted the pellet and improved cookstove system. Adopting households had more assets, lower per capita total expenditures and cooking fuel expenditures, and higher per capita hygiene expenditures. Households with married household heads and female cooks were significantly more likely to adopt. Adjusting for confounders, we find significant reduction in primary cooks' systolic blood pressure, self-reported prevalence of shortness of breath, an indicator of respiratory illness, time spent cooking, and household expenditures on charcoal. Our findings have implications for marketing of future clean fuel and improved cookstove programs in urban settings or where stoves and fuel are purchased. Analysis of follow-up surveys will allow for estimation of long-term impacts of adoption of interventions involving pellets and fan micro-gasification cookstoves. ¬© 2019, EcoHealth Alliance."	16	1	44032	Africa; Biomass; Charcoal; Cookstoves; Household air pollution	The study aim was to examine the determinants of early adoption of an improved household energy system	Rwanda	Gisenyi	-1.7	29.25	Urban	Households	2354	144	"Cooking with solid fuels and inefficient cookstoves has adverse consequences for health, envrionment, and human well-being"	"Cooking with solid fuels and inefficient cookstoves has adverse consequences for health, envrionment, and human well-being"	"Cooking with solid fuels and inefficient cookstoves has adverse consequences for health, envrionment, and human well-being"	"Private Sector, Inyenyeri"	Inyenyeri	2015	2015	Energy	Cookstove	Improved cookstove	RCT	Sub-Sample of households from large and ongoing household-level randomized controlled trial	2015	3	0	29.86	Y	Human Health and Wellbeing+; Time Savings+				Households that adopted the Inyenyuri system had significantly more durable household goods (8.7) than non-adopters (6.9)		Over 65% household heads had heard of the negative impacts of cooking with biomass and more than 87% perceived some fuels and stoves to be less smoke-producing than others	Awareness of the environmental impacts of cooking with charcoal and other unsustainably harvested biomass was associated with significantly lower likelihood of adoption of the Inyenyuri's system (p=0.05)	We found a statistically significant negative association between adopting the improved household energy system and time spent cooking (p = 0.05)	"Even among adopter holseholds, there was evidence of stove-stacking [no supporting data]"													Female primary cooks were significantly more likely to adopt stoves (p = 0.05)

Methods: A qualitative study with an ethnographic perspective was conducted in 2013/2014 based on 62 interviews with women who had participated in an improved firewood cookstove program in 2005. Thematic qualitative content analysis was performed. Results: Very few women from the indigenous communities were using the improved cookstove at the time of the study; the majority had dismantled or had ceased using it; whereas most of those from the mestizo community were using it for all of their cooking activities. In the indigenous communities, characterized by extended families, uptake of new technology was limited by traditional routine practices, rearrangement of rooms in the house, attachment to the traditional stove, a low- or non-risk perception of woodsmoke; gender relations, insufficient training, non-compliance with program recommendations and design-related aspects. Conversely, in the mestizo community, the uptake of the improved cookstove was favored by routine cooking practices in a nuclear family, a previous use of a raised cookstove and social representations on the health-disease-death effects of woodsmoke vs. the health benefits of cooking with improved stoves. The sociocultural dimension of communities and the cookstove design are aspects that either favor or limit the use of improved cookstoves in indigenous and mestizo populations. Conclusions: Effective cookstove programs must take these elements into account from their early planning stages, and blend them into implementation and follow-up.

Following the implementation of a policy to substitute kerosene use with Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in 2007, there was a significant improvement in LPG use from 10.5 percent to 47 percent of households, whilst kerosene use fell significantly from 36 to 9 percent from 2007 to 2011. There was also a 10 percent reduction in the number of households using firewood. This paper investigates LPG adoption by households who previously relied on kerosene and firewood from two perspectives: the institutional perspective, and social acceptance. Semi-structured interviews with representatives from central government to local government in addition to members of the public in six regions in Java and Sumatera were conducted. Findings indicate that the central government's commitment to implement the substitution policy‚Äîalongside effective regulatory instruments, financial support and infrastructure‚Äîwas critical to the success of the policy. Meanwhile, from a household perspective the reasons behind adoption of LPG were favourable prices, as the result of subsidies and incentives; energy market lock-in; social trust and norms; government communication and campaigns; and favourable appliance characteristics and/or kitchen design. However, there were also LPG resisters who maintained the use of firewood rather than adopting LPG. Safety concerns, cooking preferences and habitual practices were identified as the main determinants of LPG resistance. Understanding the reasons underlying cleaner fuel acceptance or resistance is essential for policy makers to determine successful regulatory pathways to improve fuel quality for better quality of life."	58		101248	Energy poverty; Modern energy; LPG; Fuel substitution; Social acceptance; Biomass; Indonesia; Energy subsidy	this study investigates the factors a ecting social acceptance and why some households remained reluctant to switch to LPG.

As the location of study was spread over large areas in Java and Sumatera, methods for data collection combined face to face interviews, telephone interviews and skype interviews. Telephone and Skype interviews were used when the researcher (also the lead author) was unable to conduct a face to face interview, usually because of the distances involved, and sometimes for reasons of the interviewee’s availability.

Little is known about adoption and use of such systems from the users’ perspective. Methods - We explored the facilitators and barriers to adoption and use of a private sector marketed household cooking energy system that uses sustainably produced biomass pellets and the cleanest burning fan micro-gasification stove currently available. We conducted 48 in-depth qualitative interviews in Gisenyi, Rwanda with decision-makers and cooks in 16 households that adopted the improved cookstove system and 8 non-adopter households. Results - Reported facilitators and barriers to adoption and non-adoption, as well as use and non-use were complex, and in some cases, contradictory. Some adopters noted that cleanliness and low smoke production were major facilitators to adoption and use, while other adopters and non-adopters said the cookstoves blackened and damaged cooking pots and produced excessive smoke. Our findings suggest that correct use of the stove mediates user experience. Cost was likewise reported as a facilitator among some adopters and a barrier among other adopters and non-adopters. Peer influence played a significant role as both a barrier and a facilitator to adoption and transcended other factors. Positive peer influence describing the cleanliness, affordability, and efficiency of the cookstove system encouraged adoption and use, while negative comments by peers regarding excessive smoke and damaged cooking pots discouraged adoption. Commentaries by some participants suggest that inadequate training and instruction may be primary causes of the discrepancies. Conclusion - Cost, cleanliness, communication among peer networks, and adequate training and instruction are important factors associated with the adoption and use of improved cookstoves and should be prioritized in the implementation of improved cookstove programs."	13	10	e0203775		to explore facilitators and barriers to adoption and use of a private sector marketed household cooking energy system that uses sustainably produced biomass pellets and the cleanest burning fan micro-gasification stove currently available	Rwanda	Rubavu	-1.678	29.257	Urban	Households	NR	24	reduced indoor pollution; improved health				Inyenyeri is a Rwandan social benefit company that leases stoves			Cook stove	Cookstove	Improved cookstove;Biomas	Saturation sampling	"48 interviews of 24 households (16 adopters, 8 non-adopters).Cookstove adopters were defined as households that had signed a contract with Inyenyeri in the past year; non-adopters had been marketed to by Inyenyeri, but elected not to sign a contract"	2016	1	1	NR	N							peer encouragement	peer discouragement	time saving; low smoke production; cleanliness	damage to cooking pots; excessive smoke production	cost savings	cost- start-up costs; fuel costs rising; purchasing protocol								overcooked food

The aim of the RLP is to contribute to Ghana's overarching goal to provide LPG access to 50% of Ghana's population by 2020. The RLP has not announced long-term program objectives. However, in the interim the RLP targeted a cumulative total of 170,000 LPG cookstoves to rural households by the end of 2017. As of November 2017, 149,500 rural households had received the LPG cook stoves. Our case study documents Ghana's experiences to date with LPG scale up. Methods We carried out a desktop review/document analysis of literature on the RLP. Each document was reviewed for information related to the elements of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework as it pertained to LPG promotion and adoption. In-depth interviews were held among key stakeholders in Ghana. Previously collected data from a field evaluation of the RLP was also assessed. Findings Generally, our evaluation suggests that the current form of the RLP is not achieving its stated goal. Our evaluation of the RLP in five rural communities showed that about 58% of households had never refilled their LPG cylinders nine months after the initial delivery of a filled cylinder. Only 8% still used their LPG at 18‚ÄØmonths post distribution. Cost and distance to LPG filling stations were the main reasons for low LPG use. Beneficiaries did not exclusively use their LPG even at the initial stages when all of them had LPG in their cylinders. Ghana is currently undergoing transitions in the LPG sector including a change from the current private cylinder ownership model to a cylinder recirculation model for the distribution of LPG. There was no evidence of a well-documented implementation framework for the RLP. Conclusion Fuel cost, poor LPG access, and an inadequate implementation framework hinder the RLP implementation."	46		94-102	LPG; Rural LPG promotion; LPG scale-up; RE-AIM framework	Assess effectiveness of program's goal to tontribute to overarching goal of providing LPG access to 50% of population	Ghana	Nkoranza North	7.68	-1.67	Rural	Households	2000	200			Project promotion was done as part of the government's efforts to reduce deforestation	"Government, Ministry of Energy"	"Government, Ministry of Energy"	2013	2013	Energy	Biomass	LPG	Mixed methods	"This evaluation used a cross-sectional mixed methods design to evaluate the RLP between November 2015 and October 2016.

ABPP was established in 2009 to promote adoption of biodigesters by rural households in sub-Saharan Africa. We use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) with information from literature, internal documents, primary data from user surveys and interviews with sector stakeholders. ABPP was implemented with the primary objective of establishing viable biodigester markets. By 2017, Kenya made most progress toward commercial viability, evidenced by market entry of companies offering prefabricated digesters and establishment of 22 marketing hubs, which link rural organizations with local construction enterprises and finance institutions. In Uganda 5 marketing hubs were established and in Tanzania 7. Between 2009 and 2017 over 27,000 households installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. Additional objectives include improving agricultural productivity by using bioslurry, improving health, reducing deforestation, and improving livelihoods. Households perceive higher crop yields (84%-91% of users), reduced fuel consumption (84%-94% of users), reduced eye problems and respiratory symptoms (45%-91% of users). Benefits most appreciated are ""easy cooking"" and ""saving time and money"". Fuel consumption tests show households with biodigesters use 2.1 to 3.3 fewer tons of wood per year than similar households without biodigesters. The ABPP case study suggests that the program has created a nascent biodigester market in East Africa. The country programs have been dynamic and adaptive, moving along the cycle of market development; however, many challenges remain. For example, while half of the adopters in Kenya exclusively use biogas for cooking, in Uganda and Tanzania fuel stacking is more prevalent, making it more difficult to achieve health and environmental objectives. In addition, high upfront cost, limited access to credit, and lack of maintenance present challenges. In 2016, 27% of biodigesters constructed between 2009 and 2013 were not working. In response, ABPP implemented call centers and launched campaigns to repair non-functioning plants. To ensure long-term viability and increase the likelihood of achieving environmental and health goals, we suggest deeper engagement with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and a targeted campaign promoting exclusive use."	46		23-31	Adoption; Biodigesters; Biogas; Cooking fuel; Rural energy access; Sustained use	"This study describes the implementation of Africa Biogas Partnership Program (ABPP) in the countries mentioned and reviews its effectiveness and adoption and sustained use of biogas using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) framework.

Due to the large fiscal burden of the LPG subsidy, increases in electricity from hydropower, and other socio-political factors, the Government of Ecuador has launched a major induction stove program (PEC) to reduce the demand for LPG. We assess the effects of the LPG subsidies and PEC using government records, interviews, academic literature, newspaper reports, household surveys, and focus groups. Household surveys, conducted in rural, northern Ecuadorian households (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ383), characterized cooking patterns and fuel access. Focus groups (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ6) were carried out with a subset of surveyed households to better characterize survey findings. The LPG subsidy was developed as part of broad social support reforms in the early 1970s, without specific aims to reduce the health impacts of household air pollution from woodfuel or provide economic benefits as part of the transition to a clean cooking fuel. Nonetheless, the subsidy has resulted in nearly all Ecuadorian households cooking primarily with LPG. PEC has generated the sale of 740,000 induction stoves since its inception in 2014, short of the goal of 3.5 million. Among the rural households surveyed, LPG use, acceptance, and satisfaction was high, however, more than three-quarters of those surveyed reported weekly woodfuel use. Induction stove ownership (17%) and use as a primary cooking fuel (1%) was low among the rural households surveyed; furthermore, households owning induction stoves reported very low satisfaction with the stoves. Here we show that nationally-representative surveys reporting only ‚Äúprimary cooking fuel‚Äù use may underestimate solid fuel use as a supplemental household cooking energy, particularly in rural areas where fuel availability issues play a stronger role in decisions about what fuels to use."	46		111-122	Liquefied petroleum gas; Induction stoves; National program; Energy transitions; Subsidies; Fuel stacking	"Assess success of 2 programs  (Compare uptake in low-, middle- and high-uptake communities of induction stove program (PEC)"	Ecuador	Carchi	1.0117499;0.664143;0.6189774	-78.2513598;-77.7205467;-77.9489851	Rural	Households	5000	383		reduce Government subsidy for LPG		Government	Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy	2014	2014	Energy	Cookstove	Electricity	Mixed methods	"Questionnaires- n questions; interviews 2-4h long, unrecorded,  focus group (6 people/community) - principal cook, $5 cash attendance incentive/compensation - transcribed from audio"	2017	0.25	3	NR	NA						"Wood-burning stoves offer the benefit through space heating, which is especially useful in cool, high-altitude areas.sample, woodfuel is widely used as a secondary cooking fuel to ration LPG and provide heating benefits, in addition to a desire to maintain traditional cooking practices."			 glass top of induction stove is perceived to be easier to clean than the tops of LPG stoves; induction stoves can be used if no LPG is available.

Nontraditional cookstove technologies can be efficacious in reducing this adverse impact, but they are adopted and used at puzzlingly low rates. This study analyzes the determinants of low demand for nontraditional cookstoves in rural Bangladesh by using both stated preference (from a nationally representative survey of rural women) and revealed preference (assessed by conducting a cluster-randomized trial of cookstove prices) approaches. We find consistent evidence across both analyses suggesting that the women in rural Bangladesh do not perceive indoor air pollution as a significant health hazard, prioritize other basic developmental needs over nontraditional cookstoves, and overwhelmingly rely on a free traditional cookstove technology and are therefore not willing to pay much for a new nontraditional cookstove. Efforts to improve health and abate environmental harm by promoting nontraditional cookstoves may be more successful by designing and disseminating nontraditional cookstoves with features valued more highly by users, such as reduction of operating costs, even when those features are not directly related to the cookstovesâ€™ health and environmental impacts."	109	27	10815-10820		To present evidence on the underlying determinants of nontraditional cookstove adoption among rural Bangladeshi households.

In many cases, households that ordered cookstoves declined to accept and pay for them at the time of delivery. Refusal rates were highly correlated with cookstove price, which may suggest that households face liquidity constraints, i.e., households could not take delivery because they did not have enough cash on hand to pay for the cookstove on the date of delivery. Indeed, the majority of households refusing to pay stated lack of cash as the primary reason. Liquidity constraints are likely a key determinant of a household’s decision to purchase: discounted prices (implying that households have to have less cash on hand) significantly reduce refusal rates for both efficiency and chimney cookstoves."							The next most-valued attributes are the ability to reduce cooking time (21%) and to accommodate a wider variety of biomass fuels (14%).

Evidence from a pilot study in Cambodia	Environmental Research Letters	1748-9326	10.1088/1748-9326/aa6008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6008	"While much work has examined approaches to increase uptake of a variety of household environmental, health and energy technologies, researchers and policymakers alike have struggled to ensure long-term use. Drawing on a pilot-scale experiment conducted in rural Cambodia, this study evaluates whether economic incentives enhance continued use ofâ€”and fuel savings fromâ€”improved cookstoves (ICS). Capital-cost subsidies that have been traditionally employed to enhance ICS adoption were augmented with rebates linked to stated and objectively measured use in order to investigate impacts on both initial and sustained adoption in the treatment group. Results show that households do respond to these rebates by adopting the intervention ICS at significantly higher rates, and by using it more frequently and for longer periods. Consistent with these stove-use patterns, solid-fuel use and time spent collecting or preparing fuels also decline. However, this effect appears to diminish over time. Thus, while economic inducements may significantly increase adoption and use of new environmental health technologies, corresponding reductions in environmental or livelihood burdens are not guaranteed. Additional research on the design and implementation of incentive-based interventions targeting households directlyâ€”such as carbon financing or other forms of results-based financing (RBF) for improved cookstovesâ€”therefore seems warranted prior to wider implementation of such solutions."	12	3	35009		Present the results from a pilot study in rural Cambodia that tests whether and how economic incentives increase use of an Improved Cookstove (ICS)	Cambodia	Kandal	11.4	104.42	Rural	Households	61	59	How can the adoption and use of ICS be encouraged in ways that ensure expected environ- mental and health benefits are realized?

The role of social relations in the adoption of improved cookstoves					"Improved cookstoves promise benefits for human health, deforestation, climate change mitigation and gender equality. In order to exploit the potential of improved cookstoves for sustainable development, various governmental and non-governmental initiatives have for decades tried to convince households in the developing world to change their behaviour and adopt the new technology. These have had very limited success. This study turns to the often overlooked but important role of social relations for individual behavioural change and examines the question of how, and how far, behaviour change techniques (BCTs) can promote adoption of improved cookstoves. Based on previous theoretical and empirical insights, the study assumes that social relations have great influence on the diffusion and adoption of new innovations. To answer the research question, the study compared improved cookstove users who acquired improved biomass-powered stoves from two different implementers, using a survey that included an egocentric social network analysis. The study findings suggest that the implementer who provided ongoing post-sales contact and support, and who marketed the stoves to existing social groups with a high level of shared identity, achieved much higher levels of adoption.The results also suggest that BCTs can be used to create a social multiplier effect, with improved cookstove users recruiting new users. The findings could be of great value for researchers and clean technology implementers alike."

However, a new class of advanced cookstoves equipped with thermoelectric generators could improve both emissions performance and adoption leading to better health outcomes. These cookstoves use electrical power provided by a thermoelectric generator to power combustion-improving fans while powering outboard USB charging ports. In communities lacking electricity access, USB levels of power could provide much-needed off-grid charging for mobile phones, small lights, and other loads. However, there is a risk that instead of being used primarily as a cooking tool, these cookstoves could be used solely as fire-powered USB chargers. Without displacing traditional cookstoves, âcharging-onlyâ adoption would result in a net increase in emissions exposure. In this study, we used custom Advanced Stove Use Monitor (ASUM) sensors to measure adoption of TEG-equipped cookstoves in 72 rural homes without electricity access in Odisha, India. To measure the impacts of the USB charging port, we randomized whether recipients received a cookstove with USB ports enabled or disabled. We found that access to USB charging ports significant increased adoption of cookstoves in âcookingâ use modes; USB-enabled cookstoves were used for cooking 3.5X more than identical cookstoves with disabled USB ports. This substantial increase in cooking came with a relatively small marginal use of the cookstove in a âcharging-onlyâ mode; just 11% of total cookstove use was in this mode. As with past work, data showed that surveys of user behavior do not correlate well with sensor-measured behavior. The trial cookstove was much smaller and more cumbersome than traditional cookstoves, but still, we found that users were willing to prepare fuel and found the cookstove useful for light cooking tasks. Access to USB charging served as a catalyst for adoption of advanced cookstoves as cooking tools and did not increase undesirable âcharging onlyâ adoption modes. This work suggests that these kinds of USB-enabled cookstoves could be an important tool to improve biomass combustion, increase adoption, and realize meaningful health benefits."	3		209-217	Cookstove; Stove use monitor; USB; Thermoelectric generator; Adoption; Survey; Sensor	How the presence of USB ports on fanpowered cookstoves influences adoption.

The availability of wood is decreasing and deforestation is a major ecological problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. The scarcity of wood is demanding for a sustainable solution. The sun seems to provide a good alternative. Solar energy is free, without unhealthy smoke or chances to burns. The idea of using solar energy for cooking is not new: many different techniques have already been tested. Most variants are expensive, and therefore not available for most families in Sub-Saharan Africa. A cheap solar cooking device is the CooKit, a cardboard panel cooker covered with aluminium foil. In the adaptation to the CooKit, as to all innovations, it is important that the users are convinced of the advantages. An important step in the adaptation process is learning how to use the cooking device; the best way to do this is by home practice. Monitoring and evaluating the real use is needed, for it is interesting to know if the CooKit is actually used, and also to find out how women have implemented the new technique in their kitchens. In 2005, the SUPO foundation started a project in Burkina Faso: Programme Energie Solaire Grand-Ouaga (PESGO). The aim of PESGO is to introduce the CooKit in the urban households in Ouagadougou by providing training sessions and home assistance. In this paper, a mid-term review on this small-scale cooking project is presented. The possibilities and challenges of solar cooking are outlined, taking the urban context of Ouagadougou in account. In PESGO, dependence on weather conditions is found to be one of the challenges: if sunrays are blocked by clouds or dust in the air, the cooking will be slowed down. The CooKit cannot replace firewood entirely, and a complementary element has to be found. SUPO is exploring the use of Jatropha oil as a complement to the CooKit. The Jatropha plant is drought tolerant and its fruits contain oil which can be used as fuel substitute. Further research on its use is interesting, because the combination of the CooKit and Jatropha oil seems to have high potential in the kitchens of West-Africa."	34	1	65-71	Sustainable energy; Solar cooking; CooKit; Jatropha; Urban area; Burkina Faso	"The aim of PESGO is to introduce the CooKit in the urban households in Ouagadougou by providing training sessions and home assistance.

Energy for Sustainable Development		https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2018.06.001		"Introduction - Over 80% of rural households in Peru use solid fuels as their primary source of domestic energy, which contributes to several health problems. In 2016, 6.7 million Peruvians were living in rural areas. The Fondo de Inclusión Social Energético (FISE) LPG Promotion Program, which began in 2012 and is housed under the Ministry of Energy and Mining, is a government-sponsored initiative aimed at reducing use of solid fuels by increasing access to clean fuel for cooking to poor Peruvian households. Methods- We conducted a mixed methods study incorporating data from publicly available records and reports, a community survey of 375 households in Puno (the province with the largest number of FISE beneficiary households), and in-depth interviews with community members and key stakeholders. We used the Reach, Effectiveness – Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to guide our data collection and analysis efforts. In a sample of 95 households, we also measured 48-hour area concentrations and personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Results - The FISE LPG promotion program has achieved high geographical reach; the program is currently serving households in 100% of districts in Peru. Households with access to electricity may be participating at a higher level than households without electricity because the program is implemented primarily by electricity distributors. In a sample of 95 households, FISE beneficiaries experienced a reduction in kitchen concentrations of PM2.5; however, there were no differences in personal exposures, and both kitchen and personal exposures were above the WHO intermediate target for indoor air quality. Among the 375 households surveyed, stove stacking with biomass fuels was reported in >95% of both beneficiary and non-beneficiary households, with fewer than 5% reporting exclusive use. In-depth interviews suggest that the complexity of the enrollment process and access to LPG distribution points may be key barriers to participating in FISE. Conclusion - The FISE LPG Program has achieved high reach and its targeted subsidy and surcharge-based financing structure represent a potentially feasible and sustainable model for other government programs. However, the prevalence of stove stacking among FISE beneficiaries remains high. There is a need for improved communication channels between program implementers and beneficiaries. FISE should also consider expanding the mobile LPG network and community delivery service to reduce physical barriers and indirect costs of LPG acquisition. Finally, increasing the value of LPG vouchers to completely cover one or two tanks a month, or alternatively, introducing behavior change strategies to reduce monthly LPG usage, may facilitate the transition to exclusive LPG use."	46		82-93	LPG; Biomass fuels; RE-AIM; Program evaluation; Clean cooking; Adoption	"The objective of this paper is to present a case study.

Moving forward, household energy policies should prioritize a range of technologies that have potential to meet local needs while delivering meaningful health and/or environmental benefits, recognizing that stove and fuel “stacking” is likely to persist. A greater focus on markets and enabling environments is needed to support sustainable and scalable energy transitions."	130		361-374	Cookstoves; Technology adoption; Household air pollution; Energy transitions	Examine stove use patterns over two years following introduction of improved biomass stoves in a previous study.

Households were enrolled in the study and a baseline household survey was conducted in Nov-Dec 2013. Following the survey, we held small meetings (with 8–16 households) during which the two stove models were demonstrated and participants drew slips of paper out of a bowl assigning them to one of four di erent intervention arms: one group received two Gyapa stoves, the second received two Philips stoves, the third received one of each type of stove, and the fourth served as the control group for the duration of the study, but were able to select two stoves of their choice at the conclusion of the study. The decision to provide two stoves to intervention households was based on the observation that most households in this area – and indeed, throughout much of the world – rely on multiple stoves and types of technologies to meet their cooking needs. For example, data from the baseline survey showed that roughly two thirds of households had both three stone and charcoal stoves (Piedrahita et al., 2016a). Thus, we expected that displacement of existing cooking methods would require multiple stoves, and perhaps multiple types of stoves, and designed our intervention accordingly. Following distribution of the stoves (Dec 2013-Jan 2014), we collected data on stove use using six rounds of household surveys (March ‘14, May-June ‘14, August-September ‘14, December ’14-January ’15, May-July ’15, and December ’15-February ’16). These surveys covered a variety of topics, including stove knowledge and perceptions, stove and fuel use, socioeconomics, and health symptoms. For each stove (traditional and improved), a stove questionnaire collected information on: the location (indoor/outdoor) and condition of each stove (including any broken parts); the number of days in the past week on which the stove had been used; whether the stove was in use at the time of the survey (“now”); whether it had been used on the day prior to the survey (“yesterday”); what fuels were used with the stove “now” and “yesterday”; what dishes were cooked on the stoves “now” and “yesterday”; and how many people were fed by food cooked on the stove “yesterday.” Starting in Jan/Feb 2013, 10–12 households from each intervention group (45 households total) had Stove Use Monitors (SUMs) installed on both of their improved stoves (for groups receiving stoves) and the most-used traditional cookstove. Additional SUMs were installed in late 2014 and early 2015 to replace broken units and cover additional three stone and charcoal stoves in these households. Additional details on SUMs instrumentation and methods are described by Piedrahita et al. (2016b)."	2013	3	2	31	NA	Time Saving/; Time Saving+	Fuel Use+; Income+	Emissions Within Homes+			"- We did not observe strong age effects in this analysis -; - we also did not observe clear education effects, though there is weak evidence that cooks with at least a primary education were somewhat less likely to be non-adopters.; - Seld-employed respondents were more likely to be low users of all stoves, more likely to be non-adopters, and less liely to be switchers.

"By the end of the study, 62% of Philips stoves had batteries that were no longer working - leaving many participants with essentially unusable stoves. 72% of Gyapa stoves had some rust damage, in some cases making the stove inoperable - deteriorating stove quality may partially explain the downward trend in Gyapa stove use that we observe over time"				"Where stoves were distributed to households for free, use of improved stoves declined over time, and substantial levels of stove stacking persisted."

Growing concern about these impacts has mobilized the international community to set new targets for universal modern energy access. However, analyses exploring pathways to achieve these targets and quantifying the potential costs and benefits are limited. Here, we use two modelling frameworks to analyse investments and consequences of achieving total rural electrification and universal access to clean-combusting cooking fuels and stoves by 2030. Our analysis indicates that these targets can be achieved with additional investment of US$200565–86 billion per year until 2030 combined with dedicated policies. Only a combination of policies that lowers costs for modern cooking fuels and stoves, along with more rapid electrification, can enable the realization of these goals. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of accounting for varying demands and affordability across heterogeneous household groups in both analysis and policy setting.

In the past, the implementation of biogas programs has been largely disappointing, in China (and elsewhere). User satisfaction with the new program is high, based on purposively collected data from 2,700 households in five provinces, and the available evidence suggests tangible environmental and economic benefits. There are strong indications of fuel switching away from fuelwood and crop residues. Less time is spent on fuelwood collection and cooking, which benefits women especially. Adopters save on fertilizers by using biogas residues. Finally, problems with suspension and interrupted supply appear lower than in earlier studies. Overall, these initial findings are grounds for optimism about the potential for scaled-up smallholder biogas to deliver safe and clean rural energy, in China and beyond, provided critical conditions are met."	19	1	8-29		"This paper provides a preliminary assessment of biogas use by smallholder farmers in rural China, using data collected from 2,700 households in five provinces."

Summoning earth and fire: The energy development implications of Grameen Shakti (GS) in Bangladesh	Energy	0360-5442	doi:10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.077		"Since its establishment in 1996, the nonprofit company Grameen Shakti (GS) has installed almost half a million solar home systems (SHS), 132,000 cookstoves, and 13,300 biogas plants among 3.1 million beneficiaries. They plan to ramp up their expansion so that by 2015, more than 1.5 million SHS are in place along with 100,000 biogas units and 5 million improved cookstoves. This article describes GS’s current activities, the contours of its programs, and likely reasons for its success. It also explores the remaining challenges facing GS and distils common lessons for other energy development assistance projects and programs around the world. After detailing research methods consisting primarily of research interviews and site visits, the article briefly explores the history of GS and summarizes its three most prominent programs. The article then identifies six distinct benefits to their programs—expansion of energy access, less deforestation and fewer greenhouse gas emissions, price savings, direct employment and income generation, improved public health, and better technology—before discussing challenges related to staff retention and organizational growth, living standards, technical obstacles, affordability, tension with other energy programs, political constraints, and awareness and cultural values."	36	7	4445-4459	Bangladesh; Energy poverty; Energy development	"This article describes Grameen Shakti's current activities, the contours of its programs, and likely reasons for its success."
