     "Abstract/Study Aims":"This dataset contains information about the ringing records of mainly great tits, blue tits, marsh tits and coal tits, and a few other bird species. The data were collected in Wytham woods, Oxfordshire, UK during 2020 and 2021, as part of a long-term population monitoring project on the breeding biology and behaviour of birds. During April - June, all unringed breeding pairs were trapped at the nest and fitted with a British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) metal leg ring. Great tits and blue tits were additionally fitted with a plastic leg ring containing a RFID tag (IB Technologies, UK). All nestlings were also fitted with these tags at 2 weeks old. Additional ringing was carried out throughout the autumn and winter across the woodland. Birds were trapped using mistnets; biometrics (mass, wing length, tarsus length, fats score) were recorded for all birds and immigrants to the population were fitted with tags. All birds were released after they were processed. These data were entered into our internal Edward Grey Institute (EGI) Bird data Management Project application (EBMP), where they underwent a number of quality checks.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"This chapter explores the different field biology studies of mammals living at Wytham Woods. It focuses first on research done on small mammals such as wood mice and voles, and examines their ecology to environmental factors. It emphasizes the 13-year study of Henry Southern concerning the small mammals. It investigates the two mammals' population cycles and looks into D. H. Chitty's hypothesis in the regulation of the size of mammal populations. It discusses the effects of habitat management on mammals and their roles in the ecosystem such as being indicators for agro-pollutants and pesticide residues. It also investigates the ecology of large mammals such as deer, weasels, foxes, badgers, hedgehogs, and squirrels.",

Prior to and during the density manipulation experiment, novel feeders were placed at random locations and the discovery of these was recorded using a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag attached to each bird and the information recorded using a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) antenna within the feeder. The experiment took place in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK between January and March 2021, as part of a study on the effects of ecological factors on social structure and information transmission. Data collection was performed by Keith McMahon, Sam Croft and Kristina Beck. The work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (Grant NE/S010335/1), The ecology of behavioural contagion in natural systems. Automated bird feeders were used to collect the described data. Each of the feeders had one access hole with a clear flap and an inbuilt Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) antenna within the perch. All birds equipped with a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag that landed on the perch were recorded, and the time and date of visits stored on a secure digital (SD) card. Feeders were visited every two to three days, to refill food, check feeder performance and collect data. For the final dataset, erroneous recordings (e.g. entries with a wrong date or tag number) were removed. Data are provided as comma separated value file for deposit into the EIDC.

The time, location and bird species were recorded using a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag attached to each bird and the information recorded using a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) antenna within the feeder. Population density was manipulated by programming automated feeders to only open for a specific set of individuals (creating low- and high-density treatments). Local population densities were recorded using automated bird feeders at six experimental and two control sites prior to and during the manipulation. The experiment took place in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK between January and March 2021, as part of a study on the effects of ecological factors on social structure and information transmission. The work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (Grant NE/S010335/1, The ecology of behavioural contagion in natural systems.)

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Between 2017 and 2020, 37 full-day surveys of flower-visiting insects at Wytham Woods, west of Oxford, were carried out using a combination of active sampling and (on most days) simultaneous pan trapping. Surveying has covered the period late March to mid-October. • These visits, and few extra visits by the author and Dr Liam Crowley, University of Oxford, have produced records for 679 flower-visiting taxa, mostly representing verified species but also a few aggregate or indeterminate taxa. The list includes records for 114 species of hoverfly and 94 species of bee and 30 species of butterfly (see associated spreadsheet). • For each taxon at each site visit, the author recorded all flower visits, the observed abundance level and the number of individuals caught in pan traps (see associated spreadsheet). • The list includes records for 59 species currently with national rarity or conservation status, though it should be noted that some of these are now known to be more frequent than their status suggests. • The dataset has produced flower-visiting records for about 130 plant species, revealing the popularity of different plant species to pollinators, the sorts of insects that visit a particular plant species, and the period of the year in which they do this. • The data allows direct comparison of an active survey protocol with a pantrapping protocol designed to run simultaneously using single-day visits of about 7 hours duration. It reveals that pan-trapping is less effective at sampling species richness than active surveying by an experienced entomologist, and that pan trapping produces a very different estimate of the abundance of flower-visiting species present, one that frequently differs from what is observed. • However, the data also show that pan-trapping extended the species list a little and revealed the presence and/or abundance of some species that were not observed during active sampling. Pan-trapping proved to be very effective for recording taxa such as sarcophagid flies and pompilid wasps. It was also relatively good at generating data on cooler, breezier days in the spring. • The data allow assessment of the current condition and ongoing management of Wytham Woods. Pollinators could benefit from improvements in the sequence and abundance of spring-blossoming shrubs plus the widening and scalloping of rides to create sunnier woodland edge and more flowery woodland conditions.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Between 2017 and 2020, 37 full-day surveys of flower-visiting insects at Wytham Woods, west of Oxford, were carried out using a combination of active sampling and (on most days) simultaneous pan trapping. Surveying has covered the period late March to mid-October. • These visits, and few extra visits by the author and Dr Liam Crowley, University of Oxford, have produced records for 679 flower-visiting taxa, mostly representing verified species but also a few aggregate or indeterminate taxa. The list includes records for 114 species of hoverfly and 94 species of bee and 30 species of butterfly (see associated spreadsheet). • For each taxon at each site visit, the author recorded all flower visits, the observed abundance level and the number of individuals caught in pan traps (see associated spreadsheet). • The list includes records for 59 species currently with national rarity or conservation status, though it should be noted that some of these are now known to be more frequent than their status suggests. • The dataset has produced flower-visiting records for about 130 plant species, revealing the popularity of different plant species to pollinators, the sorts of insects that visit a particular plant species, and the period of the year in which they do this. • The data allows direct comparison of an active survey protocol with a pantrapping protocol designed to run simultaneously using single-day visits of about 7 hours duration. It reveals that pan-trapping is less effective at sampling species richness than active surveying by an experienced entomologist, and that pan trapping produces a very different estimate of the abundance of flower-visiting species present, one that frequently differs from what is observed. • However, the data also show that pan-trapping extended the species list a little and revealed the presence and/or abundance of some species that were not observed during active sampling. Pan-trapping proved to be very effective for recording taxa such as sarcophagid flies and pompilid wasps. It was also relatively good at generating data on cooler, breezier days in the spring. • The data allow assessment of the current condition and ongoing management of Wytham Woods. Pollinators could benefit from improvements in the sequence and abundance of spring-blossoming shrubs plus the widening and scalloping of rides to create sunnier woodland edge and more flowery woodland conditions.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Despite their emblematic status, assumed knowledge on the socio-ecology of badgers, even that based on older research, proves increasingly incongruous; providing an inadequate basis to decide management policy. Starting from 1987 at the Wytham Woods research site, the 9500 + captures of 1548 individuals, for which detailed data has been gathered, have afforded unique insights into badger society. This chapter demonstrates that they do not in fact live in discrete groups, but rather trespass into supposed neighbouring group ranges and visit other group setts. Here they mate, with almost 50% of cubs fathered by extra-group males, although with scant evidence of any offspring advantages. Only limited social interactions can be observed, typically on a purely reciprocal basis, and communication mediated primarily by scent secretion and olfaction. Population dynamics also prove intriguing, interacting strongly with weather conditions, in both absolute terms and with an adverse effect of unpredictable weather variability. Dry summers exacerbate the effect of endo-parasitic infections, leading to cub mortality; and while mild winters favour survival overall, greater ranging activity is associated with more traffic fatalities. Ultimately, the chapter exposes how it is the dispersion of key resources, and in particular earthworms, which best explains badger socio-spatial geometries. This intersects with agricultural practice and land management, where the mosaic of worm-rich fields, peppered with wooded copses, that typify the British countryside have created conditions where this otherwise more solitary mustelid thrives, and is consequently forced into high-density living. The result is an awkward compromise, where their socio-ecology lags their actual ecological circumstances. [Changes in population desnity from 1987 to 2010 are summarised. Some of these data are reported elsewhere in this evidence base] ",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"This chapter reviews the various long-term population studies of birds at Wytham Woods. It looks into studies that address significant issues in field biology, including the evolution and ecology of reproductive parameters such as the timing of breeding in relation to food availability or the number of eggs that a female lays. It enumerates some of the bird species discovered in Wytham, and emphasizes on the tit studies by David Lambert Lack and H. N. Kluijver. It specifically analyses their research on the great and blue tit, and explores their physiology, populations and methods of survival, and their breeding season and patterns.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"We explore how the ground flora of a temperate woodland (Wytham Woods, southern England) changed in terms of species-richness, cover and biomass over five decades; what the drivers of change were; and possible future change as a consequence of the decline in Fraxinus excelsior as a canopy dominant. Vascular plants were recorded from 164 permanent, 10x10 m plots, distributed as a 141 m grid, in 1974, 1991, 1999, 2012, and 2018. Species presence and frequency/abundance in each plot were estimated and used to model biomass changes. Changes in species-richness, vegetation composition and structure were analysed. Stands opened out by thinning or which became denser through tree growth gained or lost species respectively, particularly non-woodland species. Deer pressure favoured the spread of Brachypodium sylvaticum and reduced Rubus fruticosus. No obvious impacts of climate change, eutrophication or of invasive species were detected in the plot records although other signs suggest these are starting to affect the flora. Just 12 out of 235 species contributed 47% of all species occurrences, 82% of the vegetation cover and 87% of the modelled biomass. We conclude that the ground flora is highly variable over decadal timescales, but the patterns of change observed differ according to the measures used (species richness, cover, biomass, etc). Site level drivers in the short-term swamped effects of slower acting regional/global drivers. Legacy effects were seen in the greater richness of specialists in the older woodland. While some impacts can be mitigated by management, others are largely beyond control at the site level. [Contribution of the twelve commonest species in terms of number of plot occurrences, mean % Cover per plot, mean biomass per plot across all five recordings are included in the current evidence base].",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The Kirby Archive comprises studies of British woodland change derived from a career as woodland ecologist with first the Nature Conservancy Council (joined 1979), its successor bodies (English Nature, Natural England). This work continued after retirement (2012), under the guise of visiting researcher in the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford. While key results have been published as formal papers, these files provide fuller accounts of some of the studies involved and the original data. The archive includes results from long-term studies established in the 1970s by Colyear Dawkins of the Commonwealth Forestry Institute in Oxford at Wytham Woods and the Warburg Reserve (Bix Bottom); resurveys of forestry plantations first examined in the 1980s and resurveyed in the 2010s; and studies of managed and unmanaged stands at a variety of other sites. Also included are additional files relating to woodland survey, monitoring and classification techniques that provide some context for the methods used. The reports have been prepared in Microsoft Word, while the data are presented in Word, Excel CSV, and PDF formats. I would like to acknowledge the inspiration of Colyear Dawkins of the Commonwealth Forestry Institute and George Peterken of the Nature Conservancy Council, who set me along this road of study; the assistance of innumerable companions, as we slogged through the brambles; and the willingness of woodland owners to allow us to work in their woods. Studies of long-term change in British woodland in response to various local and national drivers of change: forest growth, management, disease, eutrophication. An additional round of analysis from 2018 was added in January 2021 and can be found in the zip file 'Wytham 2018 data'.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Trade-offs between survival and reproduction are at the core of life-history theory, and essential to understanding the evolution of reproductive tactics as well as population dynamics and stability. Factors influencing these trade-offs are multiple and often addressed in isolation. Further problems arise as reproductive states and survival in wild populations are estimated based on imperfect and potentially biased observation processes, which might lead to flawed conclusions. In this study, we aimed at elucidating trade-offs between current reproduction (both pregnancy and lactation), survival and future reproduction, including the specific costs of first reproduction, in long-lived, income breeding small mammals, an under-studied group. We developed a novel statistical framework that encapsulates the breeding life cycle of females, and accounts for incomplete information on female pregnancy and lactation and imperfect and biased recapture rates. We applied this framework to longitudinal data on two sympatric, closely related bat species (Myotis daubentonii and M. nattereri). We revealed the existence of several, to our knowledge previously unknown, trends in survival and breeding of these closely related, sympatric species and detected remarkable differences in their age and costs of first reproduction, as well as their survival–reproduction trade-offs. Our results indicate that species with this type of life history exhibit a mixture of patterns expected for long-lived and short-lived animals, and between income and capital breeders. Thus, we call for more studies to be conducted in similar study systems, increasing our ability to fully understand the evolutionary origin and fitness effects of trade-offs and senescence.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Using data from 1100 day roosts containing a minimum of 9424 Myotis daubentonii bats, we compare the distribution of adult males, adult females, and juveniles, within Schwegler (TM) box roosts distributed across 394 ha of woodland adjacent to a river corridor in lowland England. Five social groups, containing both males and females (each comprising 55-230 adult bats per annum, using 37-127 known roosts per colony), occupy discrete roosting areas to which individuals show high inter-annual fidelity. Natal philopatry is also high, compared to between colony movements, for both sexes in our study population. Despite considerable spatial overlap and variability in roost composition over the summer (April to October), related to temporal changes in reproductive status, there is sexual segregation within day roosts. Bachelor (adult male dominated) roosts are situated significantly further from water than maternity (adult female or juvenile dominated) roosts on average. This spatial partitioning between maternity and bachelor roosts operates within rather than between colony home roost ranges, however, with adult males from some social groups found roosting closer to water than are adult females from adjacent colonies. The co-occurrence of maternity and bachelor groups roosting in close proximity, including extensive spatial overlap in roosts occupied, and temporal overlap during roost sharing between the sexes, provides novel insights into social organisation and potential drivers of sexual segregation and mating strategies for this widespread and common species within lowland habitats.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Spittle Bug data from the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) terrestrial sites. These data are collected by quadrat sampling at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol . They represent continuous annual records from 1993 to 2015. Spittle Bug adults (Philaenus spumarius) are sampled and separated by sex and by colour morph; it is likely that the proportions of morphs are environmentally determined and will therefore be good indicators of environmental change. Spittle bug nymphs are counted and the mean number of nymphs per spittle recorded. ECN is the UK's long-term environmental monitoring programme. It is a multi-agency programme sponsored by a consortium of fourteen government departments and agencies. These organisations contribute to the programme through funding either site monitoring and/or network co-ordination activities. These organisations are: Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru - Natural Resources Wales, Defence Science & Technology Laboratory, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Llywodraeth Cymru - Welsh Government, Natural England, Natural Environment Research Council, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage. Data are collected by quadrat sampling at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol. Prior to deposit of the data in the EIDC, data are managed by the ECN Data Centre at CEH Lancaster according to defined protocols. Verification steps include numeric range checks (i.e. checking if a value falls within a specified range), categorical checks (e.g. checking that a species code appears on the standard code list), formatting (i.e. that the dataset conforms to the specified data format) and logical integrity checks (i.e. checking the data make sense, e.g. that the dates in one dataset match those in a related dataset). Appropriate range settings for ECN variables have been selected following discussion with specialists in each field. Where data fall outside these ranges, a cautious approach has been adopted towards discarding data on the principle that apparent errors may be valid outliers. Such values are discarded only if there is a clear explanation (e.g. an instrumentation error) and corrections are made where possible. If the reason is unclear, the values are stored, but are qualified using pre-defined quality codes or free-text descriptions. Data providers also use these codes or free text to describe factors affecting sampling outside their control, instrument damage or site management effects.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The Environmental Change Network (ECN) coarse-grain and woodland protocols were used to assess the vegetation within the deer exclosure plots at the ECN Wytham site. In the ECN coarse-grain protocol, 2m x 2m plots are randomly selected on the site. Species presence is recorded in each of the 25 40cm x 40cm cells within the plots. In the ECN woodland protocol seedlings, diameter at breast height (dbh), tree height and dominance are recorded in 10m x 10m plots. ECN is the UK's long-term environmental monitoring programme. It is a multi-agency programme sponsored by a consortium of fourteen government departments and agencies. These organisations contribute to the programme through funding either site monitoring and/or network co-ordination activities. These organisations are: Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru - Natural Resources Wales, Defence Science & Technology Laboratory, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Llywodraeth Cymru - Welsh Government, Natural England, Natural Environment Research Council, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage. Data are collected at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol (see supporting documentation). Prior to deposit of the data in the EIDC, data are managed by the ECN Data Centre at CEH Lancaster according to defined protocols. Verification steps include numeric range checks (i.e. checking if a value falls within a specified range), categorical checks (e.g. checking that a species code appears on the standard code list), formatting (i.e. that the dataset conforms to the specified data format) and logical integrity checks (i.e. checking the data make sense, e.g. that the dates in one dataset match those in a related dataset). Appropriate range settings for ECN variables have been selected following discussion with specialists in each field. Where data fall outside these ranges, a cautious approach has been adopted towards discarding data on the principle that apparent errors may be valid outliers. Such values are discarded only if there is a clear explanation (e.g. an instrumentation error) and corrections are made where possible. If the reason is unclear, the values are stored, but are qualified using pre-defined quality codes or free-text descriptions. Data providers also use these codes or free text to describe factors affecting sampling outside their control, instrument damage or site management effects.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. Climate is known to influence breeding phenology and reproductive success in temperate-zone bats, but long-term population level studies and interspecific comparisons are rare.2. Investigating the extent to which intrinsic (i.e. age), and extrinsic (i.e. spring weather conditions), factors influence such key demographic parameters as the proportion of females becoming pregnant, or completing lactation, each breeding season, is vital to understanding of bat population ecology and life-history traits.3. Using data from 12 breeding seasons (2006-2017), encompassing the reproductive histories of 623 Myotis daubentonii and 436 Myotis nattereri adult females, we compare rates of recruitment to the breeding population and show that these species differ in their relative sensitivity to environmental conditions and climatic variation, affecting annual reproductive success at the population level.4. We demonstrate that (1) spring weather conditions influence breeding phenology, with warm, dry and calm conditions leading to earlier parturition dates and advanced juvenile development, whilst cold, wet and windy weather delays birth timing and juvenile growth; (2) reproductive rates in first-year females are influenced by spring weather conditions in that breeding season and in the preceding breeding season when each cohort was born. Pregnancy and lactation rates were both higher when favourable spring foraging conditions were more prevalent; (3)reproductive success increases with age in both species, but at different rates; (4) reproductive rates were consistently higher, and showed less interannual variation, in second-year and older M.daubentonii (mean 91.55% 0.05 SD) than M. nattereri (mean 72.74% +/- 0.15 SD); (5) estimates of reproductive success at the population level were highly correlated with the size of the juvenile cohort recorded each breeding season.5. Improving understanding of the influence of environmental conditions, especially extreme climatic fluctuations, and the identification of critical periods (i.e. spring for reproductive female bats in temperate zones), which have disproportionate and lasting impacts on breeding phenology and reproductive success at a population level, is critical for improving predictions of the likely impact of climate change on bat populations.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Background: Microbial communities (microbiota) influence human and animal disease and immunity, geochemical nutrient cycling and plant productivity. Specific groups, including bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes or fungi, are amplified by PCR to assess the relative abundance of sub-groups (e.g. genera). However, neither the absolute abundance of sub-groups is revealed, nor can different amplicon families (i.e. OTUs derived from a specific pair of PCR primers such as bacterial 16S, eukaryotic 18S or fungi ITS) be compared. This prevents determination of the absolute abundance of a particular group and domain-level shifts in microbiota abundance can remain undetected. Results: We have developed absolute quantitation of amplicon families using synthetic chimeric DNA spikes. Synthetic spikes were added directly to environmental samples, co-isolated and PCR-amplified, allowing calculation of the absolute abundance of amplicon families (e.g. prokaryotic 16S, eukaryotic 18S and fungal ITS per unit mass of sample). Conclusions: Spikes can be adapted to any amplicon-specific group including rhizobia from soils, Firmicutes and Bifidobacteria from human gut or Enterobacteriaceae from food samples. Crucially, using highly complex soil samples, we show that the absolute abundance of specific groups can remain steady or increase, even when their relative abundance decreases. Thus, without absolute quantitation, the underlying pathology, physiology and ecology of microbial groups may be masked by their relative abundance.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Fine Grain Vegetation data from the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) terrestrial sites. These data are collected at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol (see supporting documentation). In this protocol, 10m x 10m plots are randomly selected within each vegetation type on the site - species presence is recorded in 40cm x 40 cm cells randomly selected within these plots. They represent continuous records every three years (some sites record data annually) from 1994 to 2015. ECN is the UK's long-term environmental monitoring programme. It is a multi-agency programme sponsored by a consortium of fourteen government departments and agencies. These organisations contribute to the programme through funding either site monitoring and/or network co-ordination activities. These organisations are: Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru - Natural Resources Wales, Defence Science & Technology Laboratory, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Llywodraeth Cymru - Welsh Government, Natural England, Natural Environment Research Council, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage. Data are collected at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol (see supporting documentation). In this protocol 10m x 10m plots are randomly selected within each vegetation type on the site - species presence is recorded in 40cm x 40 cm cells randomly selected within these plots. Prior to deposit of the data in the EIDC, data are managed by the ECN Data Centre at CEH Lancaster according to defined protocols. Verification steps include numeric range checks (i.e. checking if a value falls within a specified range), categorical checks (e.g. checking that a species code appears on the standard code list), formatting (i.e. that the dataset conforms to the specified data format) and logical integrity checks (i.e. checking the data make sense, e.g. that the dates in one dataset match those in a related dataset). Appropriate range settings for ECN variables have been selected following discussion with specialists in each field. Where data fall outside these ranges, a cautious approach has been adopted towards discarding data on the principle that apparent errors may be valid outliers. Such values are discarded only if there is a clear explanation (e.g. an instrumentation error) and corrections are made where possible. If the reason is unclear, the values are stored, but are qualified using pre-defined quality codes or free-text descriptions. Data providers also use these codes or free text to describe factors affecting sampling outside their control, instrument damage or site management effects.

These data were collected, using the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO)'s Common Bird Census methodology (CBC), at ECN's lowland terrestrial sites using a standard protocol.

The CBC uses a mapping method in which a series of visits are made to all parts of a defined plot during the breeding season and contacts with birds by sight or sound are recorded on large-scale maps. Information from the series of visits is combined to estimate the number of territories found. Annual data are recorded but the date ranges available are variable for each site.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The extent to which a resource (e.g. nest site, food resource) is available and utilised in the wild is of fundamental importance to the understanding of species’ biology, community ecology, and for evidence-based conservation and habitat management. However, dynamics of resource use is challenging to study because it is likely determined by a complex set of (often unknown) factors and their interactions, and because of imperfect and biased detection rates (usually false absences). In this study we test for multiple drivers of summer roosting site occupancy by bats, using a rigorous statistical framework that combines multi-state occupancy models with two-class heterogeneity models. Understanding the utilization of this critical resource is a pre-requisite for any successful conservation management of (often declining) bat populations. We evaluated the importance of several external and internal sources of inter-annual roost occupancy dynamics in a community of three sympatric woodland bat species: weather, roost spatial position, roost intrinsic (unmeasurable) quality, memory effect in roost use, and inter-species dynamics. We identified the existence of two classes of the roost's intrinsic quality, and showed that bats tend to re-occupy previously occupied roosts irrespective of the roost intrinsic quality (memory effect). At the landscape scale, distance from water but not from the woodland edge influenced occupancy dynamics, with roosts closer to water having higher probability of being occupied. We also identified species-specific patterns of roost occupancy, colonisation and extinction, and between-species roost interchange. Our statistically powerful and flexible modelling approach can distinguish between multiple drivers of resource occupancy: measurable factors (environmental conditions and resource traits), unmeasurable (hidden or unknown) factors, previous use of the resource (memory effect) and community-level interactions. As such, it can be used to identify important areas for species (or communities), as well as to test evolutionary and ecological hypotheses concerning resource utilisation.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Veteran trees are fundamental to Britain's cultural and historical landscape and they have been identified as being important for nature conservation in terms of fungi, insects, birds and bat populations. Veteran trees occur as standards, coppice and pollards and a standard size cannot be defined, as ultimate diameter varies greatly between species. Chapter 1 discusses in detail why veteran trees exist today, and the different types of veteran trees that can be found across Britain.  Chapter 2 introduces the importance of veteran trees as a habitat for saproxylic invertebrates, fungi, epiphytes, bats and birds, and discusses current projects involved with promoting the importance of veteran trees in Britain. Little is known about their whereabouts and management requirements, and projects such as The Veteran Tree Initiative set up by English Nature stress the importance of recording and monitoring them with the hope of setting up a national register of ancient trees.  The commercial use of the timber in Wytham Woods throughout history has meant that due to the process of coppicing and pollarding, many trees have survived to old age. Veteran trees are therefore abundant throughout the woodland, distributed randomly in both the undisturbed and disturbed ancient and semi-natural woodland, in the secondary woodland, and in the park. The old trees in Wytham Woods have not been surveyed or assessed before now, and chapter 3 presents details of the survey carried out. Commencing with the secondary regenerated wood pasture and the ancient semi-natural sites, each compartment was surveyed to locate the veteran trees. The planted beech trees along \"The Singing Way\" were then surveyed, finally ending up in Marley Wood. A data sheet was completed for each tree, recording the grid ref., species, soil type, type of veteran, diameter, associated flora and fauna, and overall health and condition of the tree. Height was not measured because the majority of trees had either been pollarded or were too old for it to be a significant measurement.  The most commonly occurring species of ancient tree is Quercus robur, as a mature standard, however, there are some fine examples of beech, ash and oak in both pollard and standard form. Statistical analysis of the diameter measurements showed that there was no significant difference between the species.  The exact ages of the trees are unknown, but evidence and diameter measurements indicate a range between 150 years old to 400 years old. The largest tree recorded, called \"Broad Oak\", is probably an accidental survivor of the 17 century landscape and measures 227 cm dbh. Overall, the ancient trees were not in such poor condition as might be expected for their age, and chapter 4 presents details of the extensive flora and fauna that depend on the ancient trees in Wytham Woods for survival, this includes the rare beetle larva Tomoxia bucephala and the bracket fungi Fistulina hepatica.  Key management objectives for the veteran trees in Wytham Woods are given in chapter 5, stressing the importance to maintain and enhance their ecological role by keeping them alive as long as possible. There are seven key management guidelines for Wytham Woods: Ensure that a diverse age structure is maintained around the existing veteran trees to ensure a new generation of ancient trees; maintain the continuity of woodland habitat by keeping all existing veteran trees; release the mature and over-mature trees from competing vegetation; encourage the establishment of decay communities by creating suitable entry points; protect and enhance the existing bracket fungi, epiphytes and other decay communities; maintain ground vegetation as shelter for fallen wood; and reach a balance between public safety and the importance of retaining dead wood.  If we are to improve our understanding about the importance of ancient trees for nature conservation and alleviate the factors that threaten their existence - such as over enthusiastic tree surgery to make them safe, we must continue to record, monitor and care for our populations of veteran trees across the British countryside.  ;;; ",

The largest tree recorded, called \"Broad Oak\", is probably an accidental survivor of the 17 century landscape and measures 227 cm dbh. Overall, the ancient trees were not in such poor condition as might be expected for their age, and chapter 4 presents details of the extensive flora and fauna that depend on the ancient trees in Wytham Woods for survival, this includes the rare beetle larva Tomoxia bucephala and the bracket fungi Fistulina hepatica.  Key management objectives for the veteran trees in Wytham Woods are given in chapter 5, stressing the importance to maintain and enhance their ecological role by keeping them alive as long as possible. There are seven key management guidelines for Wytham Woods: Ensure that a diverse age structure is maintained around the existing veteran trees to ensure a new generation of ancient trees; maintain the continuity of woodland habitat by keeping all existing veteran trees; release the mature and over-mature trees from competing vegetation; encourage the establishment of decay communities by creating suitable entry points; protect and enhance the existing bracket fungi, epiphytes and other decay communities; maintain ground vegetation as shelter for fallen wood; and reach a balance between public safety and the importance of retaining dead wood.  If we are to improve our understanding about the importance of ancient trees for nature conservation and alleviate the factors that threaten their existence - such as over enthusiastic tree surgery to make them safe, we must continue to record, monitor and care for our populations of veteran trees across the British countryside.  ;;; ",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Veteran trees are fundamental to Britain's cultural and historical landscape and they have been identified as being important for nature conservation in terms of fungi, insects, birds and bat populations. Veteran trees occur as standards, coppice and pollards and a standard size cannot be defined, as ultimate diameter varies greatly between species. Chapter 1 discusses in detail why veteran trees exist today, and the different types of veteran trees that can be found across Britain.  Chapter 2 introduces the importance of veteran trees as a habitat for saproxylic invertebrates, fungi, epiphytes, bats and birds, and discusses current projects involved with promoting the importance of veteran trees in Britain. Little is known about their whereabouts and management requirements, and projects such as The Veteran Tree Initiative set up by English Nature stress the importance of recording and monitoring them with the hope of setting up a national register of ancient trees.  The commercial use of the timber in Wytham Woods throughout history has meant that due to the process of coppicing and pollarding, many trees have survived to old age. Veteran trees are therefore abundant throughout the woodland, distributed randomly in both the undisturbed and disturbed ancient and semi-natural woodland, in the secondary woodland, and in the park. The old trees in Wytham Woods have not been surveyed or assessed before now, and chapter 3 presents details of the survey carried out. Commencing with the secondary regenerated wood pasture and the ancient semi-natural sites, each compartment was surveyed to locate the veteran trees. The planted beech trees along \"The Singing Way\" were then surveyed, finally ending up in Marley Wood. A data sheet was completed for each tree, recording the grid ref., species, soil type, type of veteran, diameter, associated flora and fauna, and overall health and condition of the tree. Height was not measured because the majority of trees had either been pollarded or were too old for it to be a significant measurement.  The most commonly occurring species of ancient tree is Quercus robur, as a mature standard, however, there are some fine examples of beech, ash and oak in both pollard and standard form. Statistical analysis of the diameter measurements showed that there was no significant difference between the species.  The exact ages of the trees are unknown, but evidence and diameter measurements indicate a range between 150 years old to 400 years old. The largest tree recorded, called \"Broad Oak\", is probably an accidental survivor of the 17 century landscape and measures 227 cm dbh.

It is a multi-agency programme sponsored by a consortium of fourteen government departments and agencies. These organisations contribute to the programme through funding either site monitoring and/or network co-ordination activities. These organisations are: Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru - Natural Resources Wales, Defence Science & Technology Laboratory, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Llywodraeth Cymru - Welsh Government, Natural England, Natural Environment Research Council, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage. Data are collected at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol (http://www.ecn.ac.uk/measurements/terrestrial/v). This survey is conducted when plots surveyed during the coarse-grain survey fall in woodland. Seedlings, diameter at breast height (dbh), height and species dominance are recorded within a surrounding 10m x 10m plot. Prior to deposit of the data in the EIDC, data are managed by the ECN Data Centre at CEH Lancaster according to defined protocols. Verification steps include numeric range checks (i.e. checking if a value falls within a specified range), categorical checks (e.g. checking that a species code appears on the standard code list), formatting (i.e. that the dataset conforms to the specified data format) and logical integrity checks (i.e. checking the data make sense, e.g. that the dates in one dataset match those in a related dataset). Appropriate range settings for ECN variables have been selected following discussion with specialists in each field. Where data fall outside these ranges, a cautious approach has been adopted towards discarding data on the principle that apparent errors may be valid outliers. Such values are discarded only if there is a clear explanation (e.g. an instrumentation error) and corrections are made where possible. If the reason is unclear, the values are stored, but are qualified using pre-defined quality codes or free-text descriptions. Data providers also use these codes or free text to describe factors affecting sampling outside their control, instrument damage or site management effects.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Baseline Vegetation data from the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) terrestrial sites. These data are collected at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol (see supporting documentation). This was a one-off whole site baseline vegetation survey (though given the intensive nature of this survey, some sites did it over successive years) to generate a vegetation map and identify the areas within the site to be monitored. In this protocol up to 500 systemic 2m x 2m plots were surveyed and species presence recorded. ECN is the UK's long-term environmental monitoring programme. It is a multi-agency programme sponsored by a consortium of fourteen government departments and agencies. These organisations contribute to the programme through funding either site monitoring and/or network co-ordination activities. These organisations are: Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru - Natural Resources Wales, Defence Science & Technology Laboratory, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Llywodraeth Cymru - Welsh Government, Natural England, Natural Environment Research Council, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage.

This was a one-off whole site baseline vegetation survey (though given the intensive nature of this survey some sites did it over successive years) to generate a vegetation map and identify the areas within the site to be monitored. In this protocol up to 500 systemic 2m x 2m plots were surveyed and species presence recorded. Prior to deposit of the data in the EIDC, data are managed by the ECN Data Centre at CEH Lancaster according to defined protocols. Verification steps include numeric range checks (i.e. checking if a value falls within a specified range), categorical checks (e.g. checking that a species code appears on the standard code list), formatting (i.e. that the dataset conforms to the specified data format) and logical integrity checks (i.e. checking the data make sense, e.g. that the dates in one dataset match those in a related dataset). Appropriate range settings for ECN variables have been selected following discussion with specialists in each field. Where data fall outside these ranges, a cautious approach has been adopted towards discarding data on the principle that apparent errors may be valid outliers. Such values are discarded only if there is a clear explanation (e.g. an instrumentation error) and corrections are made where possible. If the reason is unclear, the values are stored, but are qualified using pre-defined quality codes or free-text descriptions.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Priority effects are known to have a major influence on fungal community development in decomposing wood, but it has not yet been established whether these effects are consistent between different geographical locations. Here, beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood disks that had been pre-colonized with three wood decay basidiomycetes were placed in seven woodland sites with similar characteristics for 12-24 months, and the successor communities profiled using culture-based techniques coupled with amplicon sequencing. On the majority of sites, assembly history differed as a result of primary versus secondary resource capture only (i.e. different communities developed in uncolonized control disks compared with those that had been pre-colonized), but on certain sites distinct successor communities followed each pre-colonizer species. This study provides preliminary evidence that differences in abiotic factors and species pools between sites can cause spatial variation in how priority effects influence wood decay communities.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Biomass production and plant species diversity in grassland in southern England was monitored before and after a change from conventional to organic farming. Our 18-year study, part of the UK's Environmental Change Network long-term monitoring programme, showed that the cessation of artificial fertiliser use on grassland after conversion to organic farming resulted in a decrease in biomass production and an increase in plant species richness. Grassland productivity decreased immediately after fertiliser application ceased, and after two years the annual total biomass production had fallen by over 50%. In the subsequent decade, total annual grassland productivity did not change significantly, and yields reached 31–66% of the levels recorded pre-management change. Plant species richness that had remained stable during the first 5 years of our study under conventional farming, increased by 300% over the following 13 years under organic farm management. We suggest that the change in productivity is due to the altered composition of species within the plots. In the first few years after the change in farming practice, high yielding, nitrogen-loving plants were outcompeted by lower yielding grasses and forbs, and these species remained in the plots in the following years. This study shows that grassland can be converted from an environment lacking in plant species diversity to a relatively species-rich pasture within 10–15 years, simply by stopping or suspending nitrogen additions. We demonstrate that the trade-off for increasing species richness is a decrease in productivity. Grassland in the UK is often not only managed from a conservation perspective, but to also produce a profitable yield. By considering the species composition and encouraging specific beneficial species such as legumes, it may be possible to improve biomass productivity and reduce the trade-off.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Bat species data from the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) terrestrial sites. The count of individual species is recorded. These data are collected while walking a defined transect using a bat detector at ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol. They represent continuous records (the transects are walked four times each year) from 1993 to 2012. ECN is the UK's long-term environmental monitoring programme. It is a multi-agency programme sponsored by a consortium of fourteen government departments and agencies. These organisations contribute to the programme through funding either site monitoring and/or network co-ordination activities. These organisations are: Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru - Natural Resources Wales, Defence Science & Technology Laboratory, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Llywodraeth Cymru - Welsh Government, Natural England, Natural Environment Research Council, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage. Data are collected while walking a defined transect using a bat detector at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol,four times each year. Prior to deposit of the data in the EIDC, data are managed by the ECN Data Centre at CEH Lancaster according to defined protocols. Verification steps include numeric range checks (i.e. checking if a value falls within a specified range), categorical checks (e.g. checking that a species code appears on the standard code list), formatting (i.e. that the dataset conforms to the specified data format) and logical integrity checks (i.e. checking the data make sense, e.g. that the dates in one dataset match those in a related dataset). Appropriate range settings for ECN variables have been selected following discussion with specialists in each field. Where data fall outside these ranges, a cautious approach has been adopted towards discarding data on the principle that apparent errors may be valid outliers. Such values are discarded only if there is a clear explanation (e.g. an instrumentation error) and corrections are made where possible. If the reason is unclear, the values are stored, but are qualified using pre-defined quality codes or free-text descriptions. Data providers also use these codes or free text to describe factors affecting sampling outside their control, instrument damage or site management effects.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Spittle Bug data from the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) terrestrial sites. These data are collected by quadrat sampling at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol . They represent continuous annual records from 1993 to 2012. Spittle Bug adults (Philaenus spumarius) are sampled and separated by sex and by colour morph; it is likely that the proportions of morphs are environmentally determined and will therefore be good indicators of environmental change. Spittle bug nymphs are counted and the mean number of nymphs per spittle recorded. ECN is the UK's long-term environmental monitoring programme. It is a multi-agency programme sponsored by a consortium of fourteen government departments and agencies. These organisations contribute to the programme through funding either site monitoring and/or network co-ordination activities. These organisations are: Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Cyfoeth Naturiol Cymru - Natural Resources Wales, Defence Science & Technology Laboratory, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Llywodraeth Cymru - Welsh Government, Natural England, Natural Environment Research Council, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage. Data are collected by quadrat sampling at all of ECN's terrestrial sites using a standard protocol. Prior to deposit of the data in the EIDC, data are managed by the ECN Data Centre at CEH Lancaster according to defined protocols. Verification steps include numeric range checks (i.e. checking if a value falls within a specified range), categorical checks (e.g. checking that a species code appears on the standard code list), formatting (i.e. that the dataset conforms to the specified data format) and logical integrity checks (i.e. checking the data make sense, e.g. that the dates in one dataset match those in a related dataset). Appropriate range settings for ECN variables have been selected following discussion with specialists in each field. Where data fall outside these ranges, a cautious approach has been adopted towards discarding data on the principle that apparent errors may be valid outliers. Such values are discarded only if there is a clear explanation (e.g. an instrumentation error) and corrections are made where possible. If the reason is unclear, the values are stored, but are qualified using pre-defined quality codes or free-text descriptions. Data providers also use these codes or free text to describe factors affecting sampling outside their control, instrument damage or site management effects.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The zoogeomorphological impact of burrowing animals varies in time and space as a result of the particular life history traits of the organisms involved, the patchy distribution of habitat resources, and fluctuations in population size. Such ecological complexity presents a major challenge for biogeomorphologists wishing to upscale from individuals to populations. Using a unique ecological data set for Eurasian badgers (Meles meles L.) in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK, we show that direct zoogeomorphological impact (soil displacement during sett excavation) is constrained by fluctuations in overall population size. Modeled digging rates for individual badgers (0.19-4.51m(3)yr(-1)) varied depending on the ecological function of the sett they are associated with, and we estimate that the whole population has displaced 304-601 +/- 72m(3) of soil during the construction of 64 setts. This represents an overall excavation rate of 6.7-19.4m(3) (6.0-17.5 t)yr(-1) in sett areas or 1.42-4.12gm(-2)yr(-1) when averaged over the whole 424ha woodland. As well as direct soil displacement, badger digging exposes material that is initially susceptible to erosion by water relative to undisturbed and litter-covered soils. Over time, setts become stabilized, representing unique landforms that persist in the landscape for decades to centuries.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Deer populations are increasing throughout the northern hemisphere, and unregulated numbers can jeopardize biodiversity and the economy. These populations are difficult to monitor using visual counts. Estimating densities from surveys of faecal pellets is reliable but time-consuming and thus, if carried out by professionals, expensive. Utilizing volunteers has clear advantages. Based on research from the UK (6 years) and Nova Scotia, Canada (4 years), we investigated the methodological refinements and training required to achieve reliable data when using volunteers. For safety reasons volunteers worked in teams of 5-10 (n = 611) under supervision of scientists. We compared faecal accumulation rate and faecal standing crop surveys using 10 x 10 m quadrats. Both methods produced similar estimates of density, but because of significant time savings and greater volunteer enjoyment we favour faecal standing crop over faecal accumulation rate surveys. Volunteer teams surveyed quadrats significantly faster than a single professional but needed significantly longer to reach and stake out new quadrats. On average, teams found 68% of all droppings. Performance of individuals was affected by training, gender, and willingness and aptitude to survey. After five quadrats men scored significantly higher than women but this difference was reduced after 20 quadrats. Age did not affect performance but willingness and aptitude correlated with ability to find and identify droppings. We conclude that volunteers can monitor deer effectively but that techniques should be modified. The provision of context, training, supervision and verification by a professional are essential. Because of the drain on scientists' time, cost-effective volunteer deployment is a question of scale.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Changes in the woody composition of Wytham Woods since 1974 are described, related to national trends in broadleaved woodland, and used to suggest the impact of future changes such as from ash dieback disease (Chalara fraxinea). Data on the tree and shrub layer from 164 permanent 10x10 m plots distributed in a grid across the Woods are presented from 1974, 1991, 1999 and 2012, on species occurrence, regeneration, contribution to the canopy and basal area. Variations in the current and past composition and structure of the Woods are related to past forestry management and natural succession/disturbance processes. These largely mirror changes shown by other surveys at a national level. Fraxinus excelsior has been increasing in prominence across the Woods since 1974, but its future is uncertain because of disease. The species most likely to increase if there is a severe decline in F. excelsior at Wytham appear to be Acer pseudoplatanus, Corylus avellana and Quercus robur. There are benefits from linking long-term studies at one site to wider less detailed surveys in order to explore the general applicability of the results.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The Wytham estate near Oxford, owned since 1943 by Oxford University, has been the site for the most intensive ecological survey ever undertaken at a single site. In addition, members of the Univer sity's Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology have carried out many studies of the birds on the estate including long-term population studies of tits and tawny owls. This research has contributed much to our understanding of the ecology and evolution of natural populations. Despite this intense ornithological activity, a general description of the estate's avifauna has never been published. This paper attempts to rectify this and describes in detail the status of all bird species recorded on the estate up until the end of 1989. In so doing it raises the official Wytham Survey list of species from 73 to 152, comprising 74 irregular and 78 regular species. These are listed in standard Wetmore order within these two broad categories. For irregular species the account describes, as far as possible, the change in status over the last 50 to 70 years. In some cases the accounts critically assess the effects of particular management practices on the bird's status. For regular species, the accounts also list D.Phil. theses undertaken by students at the Edward Grey Institute, give estimates of breeding and winter densities, and for migrants also give arrival and departure dates. The species accounts draw heavily on 'casual' records published by the Oxford Ornithological Society and these make up half of the 1,072 records presented in the systematic list. It is hoped that this review will provide a baseline for future recording on the estate, and encourage a more systematic approach to general bird recording in the future.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Over the past 200 years, deer numbers have risen world-wide. The associated increase in browsing pressure and trampling often resulted in significant vegetation changes and associated conservation problems in other taxa. In this study we investigated the effects of increased deer browsing (0.4-1.5 deer/ha) on a temperate woodland ecosystem by comparing small mammal communities and vegetation characteristics in 4 deer-free exclosures with adjacent woodland transects subjected to deer grazing.Jolly-Seber analyses of Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) results revealed that the significant reduction of bushes and shrubs in deer-grazed woodland was associated with significantly lower rodent densities than in deer-free exclosures at all times. However, whereas bankvoles (Myodes glareolus) outnumbered woodmice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in exclosures by 4:1, on average there were 1.6 times as many woodmice in the open woodland than bankvoles. Population structure did not differ between animals caught in exclosures vs. open woodland in terms of body weight, reproductive status, age structure nor sex ratio in either species.Our results highlight the need of bankvoles for denser understorey as protection from predators, compared with the woodmouse's greater agility and resulting ability to escape predators in open woodland as well as the ability to exploit arboreal habitats. The study emphasises the necessity for effective and informed deer management in order to conserve forest ecosystems.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The effect of territorial behaviour on the density and stability of Tawny owl (Strix aluco (L.)) populations was studied in three habitats during 1971-74: deciduous woodland (Wytham, near Oxford), [England, UK], mixed farmland (south Warwickshire) and conifer plantations (Dumfries). Territory size was determined by plotting the position of territorial challenges (hoots) of males; these were individually recognizable. In all three areas, pairs of owls maintained contiguous territories which changed little in size and configuration from year to year. In Wytham, this was in spite of wide fluctuations in the abundance of rodent prey. Territory size was most variable on farmland (17-74 ha) where it was inversely correlated with the area of closed woodland contained within territories. The mean size of territories was significantly smaller in the deciduous woodland (18.2 ha) than the coniferous woodland (46.1 ha) or farmland (37.4 ha). This variation was probably ultimately related to the availability of prey in different habitats. In Wytham, the annual rate of disappearance of territory-holding males was around 15% and, except after a poor breeding season, birds which disappeared or were removed from their territories were replaced rapidly. Territory boundaries remained the same after replacement and the number and spatial configuration of territories (around 30) was similar to that found 14 years earlier. There is some evidence that individual pairs would be able to rise more young if they could defend larger territories than is possible at the current population size. Recoveries of birds ringed nationally indicate that owls survive less well without territories, and that young suffer heavy mortality in their first autumn. The proportion of young recovered was highest in years when many were ringed. Examination of 276 corpses (mostly road casualties) suggests that many young starve soon after becoming independent. These observations support the idea that the stability of Tawny owl populations results from the territorial behaviour of residents acting to produce subsequent mortality among birds unable to establish their own territories. This regulation probably applies over wide areas and a variety of habitats.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Weather conditions, and how they in turn define and characterize regional climatic conditions, are a primary limit on global species diversity and distribution, and increasing variability in global and regional climates have significant implications for species and habitat conservation. A Capture-Mark-Recapture study revealed that badger (Meles meles) life history parameters interact in complicated ways with annual variability in the seasonality of temperature and rainfall, both in absolute and in phenological terms. A strong predictive relationship was observed between survival and both temperature and late-summer rainfall. This link at the population dynamics level was related to individual body-weight increases observed between summer and autumn. In addition, fecundity was correlated with spring rainfall and temperature. We investigated and confirmed that relationships were consistent with observed variation in the intensity of a parasitic infection. Finally, fecundity during any given year correlated with conditions in the preceding autumn. Badger survival also correlated with late winter weather conditions. This period is critical for badgers insofar as it coincides with their peak involvement in road traffic accidents (RTAs). RTA rate during this period was linked strongly to temperature, underlining the intricate ways in which a changing climate might interact with anthropogenic agents to influence species' population processes. Equinoctial conditions produced significant population driver effects. That is, while summers will always be relatively warm compared with winters, spring and autumn weather can be more variable and functionally delimit the 'productive' vs. nonproductive period of the year in terms of badger behavioural and physiological cycles. This study highlights how appropriately informed conservation strategies, mindful of trends in climatic conditions, will become ever-more essential to ensure the survival of many species globally.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Field margins have been widely advocated as a means of integrating agronomic and biodiversity objectives and are included in agri-environment schemes across Europe. However, information on the long-term development of field margin plant communities remains limited. We describe a long-term experiment on the effects of field margin management on biodiversity and weed species. Swards were established by natural regeneration or sowing a grass and wildflower seed mixture, and treatments manipulated the frequency and timing of mowing, application of herbicide and leaving of hay. Vegetation was monitored to evaluate the extent to which early conclusions remained valid after 13 years. Although early successional trends suggested that naturally regenerated swards would rapidly become dominated by pernicious perennial weeds, and that sown swards would exclude such species, neither was true in the longer term. Sown swards were eventually invaded by unsown perennials, but they remained distinct from naturally regenerated swards. Plant species richness declined throughout the experiment. Annuals were lost most rapidly from sown swards but, under natural regeneration, loss could be modified by mowing. Perennial species initially increased during natural regeneration before stabilising. In sown swards they declined under all treatments. Species richness in naturally regenerating swards was promoted initially by mowing twice annually. After 13 years, timing and frequency of mowing had no significant effect on species richness although it still influenced sward composition. Leaving cut hay lying produced species-poor swards. We conclude that the choice of establishment and management methods for arable field margins significantly affects the long-term conservation value of the swards. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Based on 15 years of observations of a badger (Meles meles) population at Wytham Woods in the central United Kingdom, we investigated which parameters governed demographic changes, using data recording the life histories of 868 individuals. We modeled the population in terms of a stage-classified matrix, giving an exponential population growth rate of r = 0.063 (lambda = 1.065). Population elasticity values, derived from this matrix, produced a relative order of importance of regulatory parameters governing this population growth rate, of: adult survival (P-a) > fertility (F) > juvenile survival (P-j) > age at 1st reproduction (alpha) > age at last reproduction (omega). Thus, changes in P-a and F have the greatest potential to influence population growth rate. The population underwent a dramatic change in the last 5 years of the study, with a decline, then stabilization in population growth. However, this change was not related to any change in elasticity patterns between the 2 periods. Comparing the latter period to the preceding period of marked population growth revealed that fertility rate had little actual influence, whereas adult and juvenile survival rates were far more influential demographic variables. These findings prompted a 2nd, retrospective, analytical approach, a life-table response experiment (LTRE), revealing that the importance of P-j in the LTRE contrasted with its lesser prospective importance in the elasticity analysis. Change in fertility (Delta F) apparently had little environmental or genetic scope (according to the results of either technique) to influence regulation in this population. We also tested for delayed density dependence using the theta logistic model. Because territorial animals are expected to respond quickly to the effects of density dependence, corresponding to theta < 1, our rejection of this hypothesis indicated that the restrictions of territorial sociospatial regulation are relaxed in this badger population. These results are used to highlight population vulnerabilities.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"This review identifies the major trends in physical, chemical and biological data between 1993 and 2007 at the 12 terrestrial sites in the United Kingdom Environmental Change Network (ECN) and assesses the effectiveness of the programme. Temperature and precipitation increased and sulphur (S) deposition decreased across the network. There were also significant local trends in nitrogen (N) deposition. The decreasing S deposition was associated with increasing pH of rainfall and soils and there was widespread evidence of soil pH showing recovery from acidification. Warm-adapted butterfly species tended to increase at northern, upland sites, consistent with an effect of increasing temperatures. In contrast, carabid beetle species associated with cooler northern and upland areas showed declining populations. The increasing trend in precipitation may account for a decline in ruderal plant species in the lowlands, reversing an increase associated with drought in the early part of the time series. There was no general shift in the composition of plant communities which might reflect rising soil pH. This may reflect the slow dynamics of plant community processes or a distinction between pH trends at the surface and lower soil horizons. The ECN is effective in detecting trends in a range of different variables at contrasting sites. Its strength is the ability to monitor causes and consequences of environmental change in the same programme, improving the ability to attribute causes of change, which is essential to developing conservation policy and management in the 21st century. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"We investigated the impact of agri-environment schemes, including organic farming, oil contrasting taxa, when the management of a Southern English farm was changed in the middle of a 12-year time series for an ecosystem-monitoring programme. Plant species richness, including butterfly larval food plants, increased, whilst grassland productivity decreased. There was no overall difference in butterfly or carabid beetle abundance or species richness after the management changes, but some individual species increased significantly. Moth abundance and species richness significantly increased following changes in management. There were significant longer term increases in butterfly and carabid populations from when monitoring started in 1994, which continued through the change in management. This contrasted with national trends over the same period. Warmer summers generally increased invertebrate abundance, but there was no significant trend in weather variables for the years following the change in management. This study corroborates results from short-term comparison of contrasting farms and demonstrates measurable benefits to biodiversity from the implementation of agri-environment schemes, which continue to increase over at least 5 years.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The Marsh Tit Poecile palustris is a small, hole-nesting woodland passerine whose national population in the UK has declined by more than 50% in the last 25 years. To investigate possible causes for the species long-term decline, we examined habitat selection by Marsh Tits at three scales. For individual foraging birds, winter time budgets and foraging behaviour, recorded using instantaneous sampling, differed little between Marsh and Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus, but Marsh Tits spent more time in the understorey and more time lower down in both the woodland canopy and the understorey. At the scale of breeding territories, the characteristics (numbers by size class, vegetation density, species richness) of trees and shrubs were compared using 100x10-m sample transects of ten territories in each of four woods. The characteristics of the trees differed significantly between woods whilst those of the shrubs did not, suggesting that the characteristics of shrubs were more important in territory selection by Marsh Tits than were those of trees. Furthermore, in one of the four woods (Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire), Marsh Tits were largely absent from areas with dense tree canopy, but poor shrub cover. On a national scale, using data from 157 of the woodlands surveyed by the RSPB/BTO Repeat Woodland Bird Survey, Marsh Tit abundance in 2003/04 was found to be positively related to vegetation cover at heights corresponding to the shrub layer, especially at 2-4 m. These relationships were not apparent in data for the same woods for the 1980s, but shrub cover had increased substantially by 2003/04 and Marsh Tit abundance had increased in woods with the most cover in 2003/04. Thus, factors damaging the shrub layer, such as overgrazing by deer, shading out by canopy closure and managed clearance of shrub cover, may reduce the suitability of woodland for Marsh Tits. Habitat use by a closely related species, Willow Tit Poecile montanus, is also discussed.",

The characteristics of the trees differed significantly between woods whilst those of the shrubs did not, suggesting that the characteristics of shrubs were more important in territory selection by Marsh Tits than were those of trees. Furthermore, in one of the four woods (Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire), Marsh Tits were largely absent from areas with dense tree canopy, but poor shrub cover. On a national scale, using data from 157 of the woodlands surveyed by the RSPB/BTO Repeat Woodland Bird Survey, Marsh Tit abundance in 2003/04 was found to be positively related to vegetation cover at heights corresponding to the shrub layer, especially at 2-4 m. These relationships were not apparent in data for the same woods for the 1980s, but shrub cover had increased substantially by 2003/04 and Marsh Tit abundance had increased in woods with the most cover in 2003/04. Thus, factors damaging the shrub layer, such as overgrazing by deer, shading out by canopy closure and managed clearance of shrub cover, may reduce the suitability of woodland for Marsh Tits. Habitat use by a closely related species, Willow Tit Poecile montanus, is also discussed.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The papers in this volume were presented at the British Ecological Society symposium held in the Oxford Forestry Institute on 13 July 1999. The aim was to bring together examples of different types of long-term monitoring in the UK. The papers (14) and posters/short papers (3) explore changes in British woods over periods ranging from 5 to 50 years in trees and shrubs, ground flora, invertebrates and birds. The work described deals both with natural processes such as stand dynamics, population cycles, phenology and interactions of plant host and invertebrates; and with human-induced effects - woodland management, air pollution and climatic change. As important as the results of the studies themselves, are the common threads that emerge with respect to the establishment and maintenance of long-term studies, the archiving and publishing of results, and the tension between trying to design systems are simple and might be useful to future researchers.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"In 1974-76 164 permanent 10x10m plots were recorded at alternate intersections of a 100x100m grid in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire. Tree and shrub data were collected from all the plots in 1974-76, from 27 in 1984-85 and from all but one in 1991-92.  Changes in the structure and composition of the wood are assessed in terms of canopy cover, mean tree diameter, basal area and species occurrence.  The wood has become more open (reduced canopy cover) partly through management, partly natural processes such as windthrow and disease. The shrub cover has also declined greatly, probably because of increased deer browsing.  Most stands are predominantly young growth and for the wood as a whole mean tree  diameter, basal area and tree height have increased.  The overall composition of the wood has changed little, but there has been a significant decline in mean woody species number per plot from 5.8 to 4.1, mainly through declines in understorey species and young oak. Elm cover has been reduced by disease and birch also suffered preferentially from windthrow.   Variation in the composition of the plots was grouped into six broad classes using TWINSPAN analysis. These groupings in part reflect the differences in history and management of the woods which are a mixture of ancient and recent, semi-natural and planted stands.  The results are used to indicate gains and losses in nature conservation terms for the wood as a whole. The strengths and weaknesses of this system may hold lessons for future woodland monitoring exercises.  ",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"A total of 163 permanent quadrats were recorded in 1974, 1991 and 2001 in Wytham Woods, a mixed, 320-ha woodland in Oxfordshire, southern England, UK. Data were collected on tree and shrub layers and ground flora changes. Many aspects of the woods have remained stable over the 27 years since the first recording: there has been little change in overall tree composition or in average ground flora richness. However, the shrub layer has declined; cover of Rubus fruticosus has declined, but that of Brachypodium sylvaticum has increased, probably because of increased deer browsing. Differences in the composition of ancient and recent semi-natural stands declined over the period: some ancient woodland species spread further into recent woodland (e.g. Carex pendula).",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Populations of the linyphiid spider Lepthyphantes tenuis were sampled in field margins in May, July and September in 1990-1991 and 1995-1996. Field margins were subjected to 10 grassland management regimes, which included the effects of spraying the herbicide glyphosate, cutting, leaving vegetation in situ after the cut, sowing and a control. These treatments were randomised within six complete blocks at the University of Oxford's farm at Wytham. Cutting vegetation had an immediate effect on number of L. tenuis in both spring and summer. Cutting margins in summer had a more persistent effect on populations of L. tenuis than did cutting margins in spring. The effect of cutting was not mitigated by leaving cut vegetation in situ, but no cutting ensured higher number of L. tenuis in margins, an indication that height and structural complexity of grassland vegetation were important in determining population size. Significantly fewer spiders were found in July and September plots which had been sprayed with herbicide in late June/early July. However, spider numbers were not affected by glyphosate application when samples were taken nearly a year later. Sowing a wildflower seed mixture had no significant effects on number of this generalist predator although other invertebrate groups did benefit. Field margins provided an excellent source habitat for L. tenuis. Habitats that border crop fields acted as a refugia for many other beneficial invertebrates and should be retained as an important component of the agricultural landscape.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Between 1987 and 1996 the numbers of badgers Meles meles in Wytham Woods rose from 60 to 228 adults. The area occupied by the population has not changed and thus density has also risen from 10 adult badgers/km(2) to 38/km(2). This rise parallels an increase in badger abundance seen across Britain in recent years. The hypothesis that this increase is either the consequence of improved badger protection or of changes in habitat can be rejected for this site. Instead, a link between increasing numbers and changing weather patterns, possibly resulting from climate change, is investigated. In particular, attention is drawn to a correlation between mild winters and heavier body weights of badgers in January. Furthermore socio-spatial restructuring within the population may be the mechanism that has permitted high density to be sustainable. The increase in badger numbers at Wytham has not affected population sex ratio, which has remained relatively constant at parity throughout the study.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Some agri-environment schemes promote the creation and management of a variety of non-crop habitats on farmland in the UK, yet there has been relatively little monitoring to assess how species, particularly birds, use these habitats. The present study deals with a declining UK farmland bird species, yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, and considers to what extent grass margins of arable fields are used as a foraging habitat when feeding nestlings, Studies were carried out in lowland mixed farmland in southern England.Grass margins and other non-crop field boundary habitats, such as hedgerows and ditches, were selected relative to cropped areas by yellowhammers. No significant difference was found between use of cut and uncut grass margins. Studies have shown that grass margins support high densities of invertebrates and their provision at the edge of arable fields would benefit yellowhammers during the breeding season both as habitat for prey and as nesting habitat. During the breeding season from May to August, management should create cut and uncut grass margins in close proximity to each other. This could be achieved by cutting only the outer edge of the grass margin, maintaining cover next to the hedgerow. Cut areas would provide easier access to food resources for birds and prevent weed encroachment to the crop, whilst adjacent uncut areas would maintain invertebrate sources and provide nesting cover for yellowhammers.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The possible impacts of increased deer populations on small mammal ecology in British lowland woodlands are reviewed. These impacts occur mainly through two pathways. First, by the modification or removal of habitat which influences food supply, cover and the balance of competition between the species. Secondly, through direct competition for resources, particularly food supplies. Losses of woodland ground vegetation may provoke major changes in small mammal community structure which, in the extreme, may decrease from five to eight species, or more, to just wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Reduction of understorey species such as hazelnuts (Corylus avellana) or loss of shrub diversity, would be expected to lead to declines in yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and common dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius). Reduction of early succession mixed scrub and grassland may reduce colonization by shrews, harvest mice (Micromys minutus) and field voles (Microtus agrestis), although in woodland rides, field voles may benefit from preferential grazing of grasses by deer. Impacts on regeneration which may delay or inhibit canopy/understorey closure may encourage the ground and shrub vegetation and so favour species with a preference for ground cover such as the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). Reductions in the availability of foods (e.g. mast crops) may reduce the potential for high population densities, particularly of bank voles, wood mice and yellow-necked mice, decrease the lengths of breeding seasons, and further affect community structure. If rodent densities are lowered, avian and terrestrial predators are likely to suffer reduced breeding success and tawny owls (Strix aluco) may prey more heavily on bank voles if their favoured ground cover is reduced. Studies at Wytham Woods, near Oxford, from 1949 to 1999, indicate that a significant reduction in bank vole, but not wood mouse, numbers has occurred; this is suggested to be the result of observed changes in the woodland vegetation, including a significant reduction in the ground cover of bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.). Deer, as well as increased canopy shading, are probably the major factors causing this change in habitat and small mammal density.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The study site, Somerford Mead, is located on the river Thames floodplain and was a species-rich flood-meadow in the 1950s. In the 1960s and 1970s it was subjected to intensive grassland management with regular NPK additions and occasional herbicide treatment. In 1981 Somerford Mead was ploughed for the first time and converted to arable land. Seeds of an Alopecurus pratensis-Sanguisorba officinalis flood-meadow community (MG4; Rodwell 1992) were sown onto prepared soil in the autumn of 1986, and botanical records were made from 1985 to 1999. From 1989 to 1999, three replicates of three treatments: cow-grazing, sheep-grazing and no-grazing were introduced after hay-cutting. Analysis successfully separated the establishment phase from the experimental phase and showed a significant difference between the grazed and ungrazed treatments. Abiotic and biotic factors which might contribute to successional trends are discussed. A convoluted pattern for each treatment could be attributed in part to intrinsic 'cycles' of perennial hemicryptophytes behaving as short-lived species and in part to the percentage frequency of many species which was reduced in 1990 and 1995/1996, years of drought. After the initial inoculation of MG4 seed and the disappearance of arable therophytes, recruitment of new species was very slow. Coefficients for Somerford Mead matched against MG4 (Rodwell 1992) produced an equilibrium within three years. It subsequently fluctuated over a 10-yr period well below the level of Oxey Mead, the donor site. Land managers should ensure that their proposed site has the right soils and hydrology for MG4 grassland and that traditional management of hay-cutting and aftermath grazing is practised. Only one cut a year in July could lead to a reduction in percentage frequency of most species except Arrhenatherum elatius.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The ground flora (vascular plants <2 m high and excluding trees and shrubs) was recorded in 1974 and 1991 in 163 permanent plots arranged in a systematic grid across Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK. The woods (320 ha) are predominantly deciduous but of varying ages and management types. There were no significant differences between years for total number of species found (173 and 167 in 1974 and 1991, respectively), the mean richness per plot (16.7 and 17.2, respectively) and the breakdown of species between different species types (ancient woodland, other woodland or non-woodland). However, mean ground cover declined from 80% in 1974 to 64% in 1991. Ancient woodland indicator species showed less change between the years than species associated with open glades and grassland patches in the woods. Some species increased in frequency throughout the woodland including Arum maculatum, Brachypodium sylvaticum, Deschampsia cespitosa and Poa trivialis, while others such as Ajuga reptans, Angelica sylvestris and Circaea lutetiana decreased. Mean cover of Rubus fruticosus per plot decreased from 35% to 6% and of Mercurialis perennis from 32% to 24%. More species were lost from plantations than from semi-natural stands. The results are consistent with effects of changing conditions associated with stand growth and an increase in browsing by deer. It is concluded that changes in the ground flora as well as the woody layers, and in managed as well as unmanaged stands should be monitored if nature conservation objectives are to be met. The plot system used at Wytham is also briefly evaluated.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"We investigated the effects of crop type on numbers and movements of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus in field edges and in arable fields containing either winter wheat, winter barley or oil-seed rape, grown on a 3-year rotation. We also investigated the effect of habitat (field centre vs edge), and of season and year. This was done at the individual level using radio-tracking, and at the population level using live-trapping. Wood mouse population size (estimated as minimum number alive) was significantly affected by season. Wood mouse numbers also differed between crop types. Rape field centres and edges had significantly lower numbers than did barley or wheat field centres and edges. Populations were largest from April to July, when the crop was tall. In winter, significantly more mice were found in field edges compared with field centres. The patterns of movement of individual mice also showed differences between habitats and between seasons. Mice were found to move more quickly when they were tracked through rape compared with the other crops. When the crop was growing, they moved faster through field edges bordered with hedgerow than they did through wood. This pattern was reversed later in the year when the crop was tall. The distances moved during a session of tracking showed differences which paralleled those for speed of movement. Also, males tended to move faster than females. Differences between the sexes in movement patterns were affected by season; when the crop was down (in winter) females moved further than males during a session of tracking, but when the crop was growing and tall, this was reversed.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The impact of field manipulations of local climate on terrestrial gastropod populations and how they may affect the dynamics of the plant community were studied in a calcareous grassland. The experimental site was located in a grassland at the Wytham estate, Oxfordshire, UK. Manipulations representing two climate change scenarios in a factorial combination were used, these were warmer winters with increased summer rainfall, and warmer winters with summer drought. The climate manipulations had a significant effect on the relative abundance of molluscs. However, no important changes in species composition were found. Distribution and densities of snails and slugs were affected because of changes in the physical environment and the vegetation in the grassland. The responses of different species to the climate manipulations were strongly influenced by their phenological traits and food preferences. Potential responses of mollusc populations to a changing climate are discussed.",

Experiments and observations were carried out during the TIGER programme, 1993-97, at Wytham Wood, Oxford, and experimentally in a controlled environment (solardomes) at the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Bangor, Wales. Tree cores from Wytham Wood indicated that mature Q. robur trees grew best at high temperatures and rainfall, but with low caterpillar populations. Young trees grew less well at elevated temperature, probably because they lost more water than they gained. Elevated temperatures advanced budburst, reduced foliar nitrogen and increased leaf toughness. Operophtera brumata eggs laid later or maintained at cooler temperatures than average required fewer heat units to hatch. Caterpillars took up to 50 days to complete growth at field temperatures but did so in only 20 days at a constant 15 degrees C. The mass of Parus spp. chicks at day 15 (day 1= egg hatch) was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with rainfall during the growing period. At elevated temperature, budburst and moth egg hatch were synchronized, but earlier. Late feeding larvae and larvae fed on leaves from trees grown at elevated temperature produced smaller pupae. Pupal mass was unaffected when caterpillars and trees were maintained together under the same conditions. Delaying egg hatch in Parus spp., to simulate conditions at elevated spring temperatures, resulted in reduced chick mass, body size and fledging success. This occurred because the chicks were fed later and prey quality was poorer, because the peak of caterpillar biomass was missed. The authors predict that moth reproductive output will be retained at elevated temperatures because both leaves and caterpillars develop faster. Brood size in birds may be reduced because they cannot lay early enough to coincide with the narrower peak of food abundance.",

Tree cores from Wytham Wood indicated that mature Q. robur trees grew best at high temperatures and rainfall, but with low caterpillar populations. Young trees grew less well at elevated temperature, probably because they lost more water than they gained. Elevated temperatures advanced budburst, reduced foliar nitrogen and increased leaf toughness. Operophtera brumata eggs laid later or maintained at cooler temperatures than average required fewer heat units to hatch. Caterpillars took up to 50 days to complete growth at field temperatures but did so in only 20 days at a constant 15 degrees C. The mass of Parus spp. chicks at day 15 (day 1= egg hatch) was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with rainfall during the growing period. At elevated temperature, budburst and moth egg hatch were synchronized, but earlier. Late feeding larvae and larvae fed on leaves from trees grown at elevated temperature produced smaller pupae. Pupal mass was unaffected when caterpillars and trees were maintained together under the same conditions. Delaying egg hatch in Parus spp., to simulate conditions at elevated spring temperatures, resulted in reduced chick mass, body size and fledging success. This occurred because the chicks were fed later and prey quality was poorer, because the peak of caterpillar biomass was missed. The authors predict that moth reproductive output will be retained at elevated temperatures because both leaves and caterpillars develop faster. Brood size in birds may be reduced because they cannot lay early enough to coincide with the narrower peak of food abundance.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. On the basis of juvenile:adult ratios among netted birds and studies of moult, inferences are drawn about seasonal and annual variation in the breeding output of a bullfinch population studied near Oxford, in southern England.2. In most years during 1962-66, the juvenile:adult ratio among netted birds increased from July or August to October, and then declined. The ratio in October, taken as a measure of annual productivity, varied between 2.8 and 5.5 in different years.3. In the Oxford area, egg-laying among bullfinches occurred between mid-April and late August, so that the last young of the year left the nest in late September/early October. However, not all pairs continued breeding this late in the year. Individual bullfinches started to moult when they finished breeding. The proportion of adults which started moult after 20 August (implying successful breeding from eggs laid after mid-July) varied between 7 and 68% in different years (or between 19 and 63% using a different method of estimation). Juveniles from these late nests, identified as those starting moult after 31 August, formed 24-61% of the total juvenile population in different years, the rest having been produced from clutches begun before mid-July.4. In the 2 years when the greatest proportions of adults started to moult after 20 August and the greatest proportion of juveniles started after 31 august, the juvenile:adult ratios in October were highest. By implication, the two-fold variations in overall productivity between years were associated primarily with variations in the amount of late breeding.5. This study, based on moults and age-ratios among netted birds, provided information on seasonal productivity that was practically impossible to obtain in this species by conventional nest finding. An implication was that an interaction between the seasonal pattern of breeding in particular years and a seasonal trend in predation on nest contents, had major effects on overall annual productivity.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The effects of ten different management regimes on the abundance and species richness of Araneae on pre-existing and newly expanded zones of field margins surrounding arable fields are compared in a large-scale experiment conducted between 1987 and 1991. Most of the management regimes involved varying the timing and frequency with which the field margins were cut. There was no evidence of consistent temporal trends in the abundance and species richness of Araneae on either the existing or expanded zones of the field margins during the first four years of the experiment. However, lowest numbers were recorded before expansion of the margins in 1987, and highest numbers in the final sample, in 1991. Araneae remained less abundant, and less species rich, on the newly expanded than on the existing zones of the field margins four years after they were 'set-aside'. Cutting reduced both abundance and species richness. Regimes which included cutting in mid-summer had a greater impact which persisted for longer than did those involving cutting in spring and autumn. Removal of cut material was associated with lower species richness than leaving it in situ. Sowing the margins with a wild flower seed mixture was associated with increased abundance and species richness of Araneae, Annual spraying with a broad-spectrum, non-persistent herbicide reduced the abundance of Araneae but the effect was not detectable until several months after the application of the spray. Both the species richness and abundance of Araneae were positively correlated with a measure of vegetation height made on the field margins in September, on both the pre-existing and newly expanded zones of the margins. The extent to which management practices which benefit Araneae are compatible with both the management requirements for various other taxa, and the overriding constraint of effective pernicious weed control on field margins, is discussed.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Using a long-term demographic data set, we estimated the separate effects of demographic and environmental stochasticity in the growth rate of the great tit population in Wytham Wood, United Kingdom. Assuming logistic density regulation, both the demographic (sigma(d)(2) = 0.569) and environmental (sigma(e)(2) = 0.0793) variance, with interactions included, were significantly greater than zero. The estimates of the demographic variance seemed to be relatively insensitive to the length of the study period, whereas reliable estimates of the environmental variance required long time series (at least 15 yr data). The demographic variance decreased significantly with increasing population density. These estimates are used in a quantitative analysis of the demographic factors affecting the risk of extinction of this population. The very long expected time to extinction of this population (approximate-to 10(19) yr) was related to a relatively large population size (greater-than-or-equal-to 120 pairs during the study period). However, for a given population size, the expected time to extinction was sensitive to both variation in population growth rate and environmental stochasticity. Furthermore, the form of the density regulation strongly affected the expected time to extinction. Time to extinction decreased when the maximum density regulation approached K. This suggests that estimates of viability of small populations should be given both with and without inclusion of density dependence.",

The abundance and species richness of butterflies on expanded-width uncropped arable field edges, which were subject to 10 contrasting, experimental management regimes, were measured using transects in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The effects of the management regimes on a number of botanical variables, likely to be of importance to butterflies, were measured.2. On the experimental field edges, butterfly abundance and species richness fluctuated between years and peaked at different times each year.3. Butterfly abundance and species richness differed between experimental treatments. Plots which were either cut in the spring and autumn, or not cut at all, attracted more individuals and species of butterfly than did plots cut in the summer. Sowing with a grass and wild flower seed mixture increased butterfly abundance. Butterfly abundance declined on swards sprayed once annually with herbicide.4. Mowing, sowing and spraying had significant effects on mean flower abundance, on the annual and perennial components flowering in the sward, and on the abundance of commonly used nectar sources and larval host-plants.5. Stepwise multiple regression analyses on butterfly and plant data showed that the abundance of adults of most butterfly species was most closely associated with the abundance of flowers of key nectar source species.6. The results are discussed in relation to resource provision for larval and adult butterfly stages. Recommendations (emboldened in the text) are made for the conservation management of butterflies on arable farmland.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Vegetation change during the first 6 years of secondary succession in a calcareous former arable field and the effect of controlled grazing by sheep was studied in 1984-89 at the University of Oxford's Wytham estate, UK. The vegetation was grazed in 30 x 30 m paddocks from 13 to 23 Apr. or 9 to 24 Sep. by 3 sheep or from Apr. to Nov. or Aug. to Nov. by 6 sheep/paddock, or was not grazed. The results were compared with similar data from 40- to 100-years-old grassland nearby. The relative effects of time, place, sheep grazing and season of grazing on community change were assessed by canonical community analysis: detailed responses of the commoner species were investigated by analysis of variance. The two approaches complemented each other; multivariate analysis clearly separated effects on the community scale but was weak at detecting complex interactions. Grazing deflected succession but was subordinate to an intrinsic rate of vegetation change and to local variations in its direction. Succession only moved immediately towards the composition of the local ancient grasslands under the heaviest grazing treatment. Irrespective of grazing treatment and local conditions, secondary succession towards species-rich calcicolous grassland appeared to take at least a century to run its course. It was suggested that grazed grassland and forest successions could operate over similar time-scales. The implications for countryside management and 'creative conservation' are discussed.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. Spiders were sampled, by suction (D-vac) and direct counts of their webs, in a controlled sheep grazing experiment on calcareous ex-arable land and in old calcareous grassland. Results from 1985-89 are presented.2. Heavily grazed assemblages were dominated by a group of Linyphiidae, also characteristic of disturbed land. Large web-spinners were most sensitive to grazing, preferring ungrazed controls because of their dependence on rigid plant structures.3. DCA ordination of D-vac data suggested that only heavy grazing (in spring and autumn) produced a distinct assemblage. Three other grazed treatments produced impoverished versions of ungrazed control assemblages.4. The dominant successional trend was a gradual accumulation of species, especially in ungrazed controls. This process was incomplete by 1989: old grasslands contained many species, including some characteristic of calcareous grassland, which had failed to colonize the ex-arable field 7 years after abandonment.5. Most features of the assemblages could be explained by the effects of grazing on plant architecture, in contrast to other invertebrates studied in the same system, which were more strongly affected by plant species composition.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Ten species of earthworm were recorded from a Fagus sylvatica woodland (Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire). Compared with the lumbricid fauna of two Swedish beech woods (6 and 8 species) the \"equitability\" component of species diversity was low, which implies that maximum ecological diversity has not yet been attained in the 150-year-old woodland. Two species associations were identified: (i) A.rosea - L.terrestris - L.castaneus - D.mammalis, and (ii) A.rosea - A.caliginosa - L.terrestris - D.mammalis. Allolobophora caliginosa was the numerically dominant form and together with A.rosea comprised approximately 65% of the total numbers. These species associations differed from the Dendrobaena octaedra - L.rubellus association in Sweden. The differences are explained in terms of soil characteristics; pH was important in this respect (present site pH 7.3 to 8.0, Swedish sites pH 3.5 to 4.2 and 5.5 to 6.6). Computer derived maps of distribution according to abundance are given for the within site distributions of each of the ten species. Multiple regression and contingency table analyses showed that soil depth, soil moisture characteristics, litter standing crop and ground vegetation type are all important factors. It is suggested that inter-specific competition between earthworms on the study site (particularly for food) is reduced by ecological separation of the species in time and space and by different food preferences.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"(1) Interspecific competition for nest sites was studied in blue and great tits nesting in boxes in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire. (2) The breeding density of both blue and great tits was dependent on the density of nest boxes over the range of two to eight boxes per hectare. (3) Changes in blue and great tit densities, from one year to the next, were negatively correlated at low densities of nest boxes and positively correlated at high nest-box densities. The relative density of blue tits increased as the density of available nest sites increased. The spatial variance of blue tit mean density was dependent on great tit density over the same range of nest-box densities. The spatial variance of the great tit population was independent of blue tit density. (4) Blue and great tits do not maintain interspecific territories or space out their nest sites. They do compete for the same favoured nest sites. (5) Great tits are good interference competitors and are relatively more successful than blue tits where nest sites are limiting. Blue tits are good exploitation competitors and are successful where high breeding densities result in competition for food during the breeding season. (6) The patchiness and abundance of resources such as food and nesting sites may form an important dimension in the calculation of limiting similarity for competing species. ",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Trichoniscus pusillus extracted from topsoil and litter in a beech woodland produced two distinct generations per year (May-June and July-August). Members of the early generation reproduced at c. 12 and 15 months of age while those of the later generation did so at c. 12 and 22 months. Mortality was higher in summer than in winter. Mean density and biomass were 480-500 individuals m-2 and 256-268 mg live wt. m-2. Annual respiratory metabolism at 0.399 l O2 m-2 contributes 0.15% of the total soil metabolism.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Two methods of extraction were used in the estimation of snail population densities in woodland litter. The time-consuming Vagvolgyi technique proved to be 6.25 times more efficient than infra-red heat extraction but the results obtained by the latter method could be easily corrected to conform with those of the former. Snail density varied with season (winter, 1,000-1,250 m-2, summer, 50-600 m-2), the annual mean density being 645 m-2. The annual mean ash-free dry weight biomass was 176 mg m-2, and annual population metabolism equalled 0.894 l O2 (= 17.84 kJ m-2 year-1). Two independent estimates of the energy equivalent of food consumption gave values of 25.37 and 57.98 kJ m-2 year-1, which account for 0.54 and 1.23%, respectively, of the known ground litter disappearance of 4,716.58 kJ (= 235 g dry wt. m-2 year-1).",

A large-scale field experiment at Wytham, Oxfordshire, UK was used to examine the establishment of forbs in a forb-grass mixture sown on field margins extended in width by fallowing adjacent arable land. Both the number of sown forb species and the abundance of individual species was much lower on the existing margins than on the newly fallowed extensions over a three year period. The numbers of sown forb species on the fallowed extensions were relatively constant over a five-year period but differed significantly under contrasting cutting regimes. Species richness increases with spring and autumn cutting compared with cutting in spring and summer and with two cuts/year compared with one cut/year. Species richness decreased with less favourable management regimes.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"(1) In a 27 ha deciduous woodland at Wytham, near Oxford, 344 samples (scats) were collected from live-trapped weasels, principally from September 1968 to March 1970. The home ranges and fleas of these weasels were described previously (King 1975, 1976). (2) In 215 samples containing wild-caught prey, 245 vertebrate itels were identified: fifty-one birds or eggs; one rabbit; one mole; and 192 small rodents (including eighty-nine bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), forty field voles (Microtus agrestis), and thirty-four wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus)). The ages of the prey, and the species of the birds eaten, were unknown. (3) The most marked feature of the seasonal variation in the prey taken was the large number of eggs eaten in spring. (4) The differences in diet between six individual male weasels reflected differences in the habitats of their home ranges. (5) The density of bank voles and wood mice together varied from twenty-one to thirty-nine individuals per ha from September 1969. During this time the weasels were estimated to have eaten an average of 8-10% per month of the total populations of each species. Lagomorphs were rare in the wood; insectivores were common but almost never eaten. (6) Seasonal and local variations in the survival of wood mice bore no relationship to the distribution of resident weasels. (7) Predation by weasels usually accounted for only a small proportion of the wood mice and bank voles disappearing from the study area. (8) Weasels ate bank voles and wood mice in approximate proportion to their availability. Relatively more bank voles were taken in winter, when more weasels were present, because of differences between bank voles and wood mice in their preference for cover, and reactions to being hunted. The difference might have been biologically significant, although statistically insignificant. (9) The ecological eficiency of the rodent-weasel food chain averaged 0.6%. (10) The size of the territory occupied by weasels seems to be related to the density of prey rather than to e.g. the hunting skill of the owner. (11) Predation by weasels appeared to have no observable effect on the density or survival of small rodents in Marley Wood, but its effect on tits (Paridae) nesting in boxes is greater, for reasons discussed.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The project aimed to devise, install and eventually test a system of long-term inventory of mixed woodland, using permanently but inconspicuously marked plots and computer-processed observations.The immediate stimulus for the present project was the realisation that most British forests were - or would shortly be - going through same drastic changes as a result of afforestation or changes of dominant species, and yet little or no statistically representative surveillance was in hand, or even planned. For instance, we found cases of being unable to trace or measure the onset and spread of quite obvious man-induced erosion, of damage by grey squirrel, invasion by turkey oak and sycamore, disappearance locally of English oak, and the spread (or retreat) of herbaceous flora and dependent wildlife into (or out of) pure conifers. Still less was it possible to make predictions of the future composition of polyspecific woodland in nature reserves or to detect the first signs of relatively longterm changes in a production-forest soil. In 1973 we knew of only one attempt to set up a comprehensive vegetation surveillance system in Britain (Bunce & Shaw, 1973), and in our opinion this made insufficient provision for precise relocation of the observation points in future years. We considered these to be essential characteristics of a method designed to detect changes, when sampling error between occasions must be of the smallest possible, and must be unconfounded with the ordinary spatial sampling error of any scattered sample units.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Tree litter fall was measured from May 1969 to April 1973 and varied between 205 and 388 g/m2/year. Peak standing crops of the ground flora were determined between September 1969 and October 1972 and fell in the range 17.3 to 20.9 g/m2/year. Litter losses due to wind action had a net value of 8 g/m2/year and the mean above ground litter input to the soil was 235 g/m2/year. Between February 1971 and January 1973 above ground litter loss due to decomposition was calculated from litter standing crop depletions and litter turnover times. It was estimated to be 235.8 g/m2/year. Steady state conditions were thus assumed for this woodland. The contribution to litter from dying roots was estimated at 92 g/m2/year and hence the total input of dead organic matter to the site was 327 g/m2/year. Soil metabolism, measured as carbon dioxide evolution, showed a significant correlation with temperature and during 1973-1974 had a dry matter equivalent of 342 g/m2/year. The difference between the above ground litter input (235 g/m2/year) and the dry matter equivalent of soil metabolism (342 g/m2/year) was attributed to the decomposition of root litter, root  respiration and the respiratory activity of fungal myeorrhizae. Total organic matter decom- position accounted for 95% of total soil metabolism whilst the contributions by root and  mycorrhizal respiration approximated 4 and 1%, respectively.; ",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"In further work on the predators of Operophtera brumata (L.) in a wood near Oxford [cf. RAE/A 58, 249, etc.], the components of the mortality of the soil-dwelling stages of the Geometrid were studied beneath 12 oak trees (Quercus robur) during the generation of 1972. The total mortality inflicted by soil-dwelling predators was divided into three consecutive mortalities: the mortality of larvae between dropping from the canopy and pupating in the soil, which was measured as the difference between the logarithms of the density of falling larvae trapped in metal trays and the initial density of pupae determined by soil sampling, the mortality of pupae, which was estimated by planting winter moth cocoons, some within areas where predators were excluded, and the mortality of the flightless adult females between emergence and climbing the tree trunks, which was estimated by capture-mark-release-recapture of females. Average estimates of the mortalities, expressed as percentages of the population of healthy larvae that dropped from the canopy, were 14% for larval, 62% for pupal and 5% for adult mortality and 81% for total predation in the soil. Pupal predation appeared to be mainly due to Carabids and Staphylinids. Carabids were estimated to have destroyed 38% (23% attributed to Abax parallelepipedus (Pill. & Mitt.) and 15% to Feronia spp.), Philonthus decorus (Grav.) and perhaps other Staphylinids 30%, and small mammals 4% of the initial population of pupae. Larval and adult mortalities were not detectably density-dependent, but pupal mortality was density-dependent between trees with different densities of O. brumata. The results of cocoon planting and pitfall trapping of predators suggested that this density-dependence may have been due to the behavioural responses of Philonthus and Feronia to the density of the Geometrid.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) were trapped on two similar areas at Wytham near Oxford. On the experimental area of 1.1 ha wheat was provided at each of 45 trap points; the adjacent control area was 1.5 ha. During the spring growth period the mean weights of males and females on the experimental area were up to 20% higher than those on the control. In the spring of 1968 the decline in numbers on the control area was greater than on the experimental plot. In the summer of 1968 and the late winter of 1928-69 the experimental area had twice the population of the control. The supplementary food increased both immigration and survival. A short interruption in the food supply on the experimental area coincided with a sudden decrease in numbers and survival. The increased density on the experimental area in summer 1968 was shown to be the result of the better survival of overwintered and juvenile mice. In the autumn of 1968 the increase in numbers was later on the experimental area. Factors other than food supply affect wood mouse populations, especially in summer.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"A study of 18 years' data from Wytham Wood, Berks., showed that a high proportion of larvae of L. dubia dissected from prepupae of O. brumata that had fed on Oak (Quercus robur) were encapsulated and dead, whereas many parasites in prepupae of O. brumata that had fed on Crataegus oxyacanthoides, Prunus spinosa or Corylus avellana were alive. The relative failure of parasites of O. brumata on Q. robur is discussed in relation to the timing of attack by L. dubia and the rate of growth of O. brumata on different trees. The study may partly explain the apparently conflicting views of different workers on the importance of L. dubia.KEYWORDS: Corylus avellana \\ Crataegus oxyacanthoides \\ insect pests \\ biology feeding behaviour \\ Lepidoptera \\ Parasites \\ insect pests \\ factors affecting parasite population \\ insect pests \\ natural enemies \\ insects \\ parasites \\ Prunus spinosa \\ Quercus roburs.s. insect pests \\ Lepidoptera",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"A study in Wytham Woods, near Oxford, in a mature Beech stand. Of a total litter production of 652 g./sq.m., 584 g. was Beech material, including 58% leaves, 5.2% bud scales, 27% fruits and 10% twigs and bark. Over 70% of the litter fell in Oct-Dec. The estimated contribution of the field layer to total litter production was 3.4%. The weight of the litter layer in Sept. 1968 was 2700 g./sq.m., suggesting a turnover time of ca. 4.5 years: The mean population of snails (21 species) was estimated at 489/sq. m. and their annual biomass at 699 mg. dry weight. It was calculated that the snails ingested not more than0.35-0.43 % of the annual litter produced, assimilating 49%.KEYWORDS: Fagus sylvatica inc.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Estimates of the relative volumes of the different foods eaten by wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) in woodland edge habitat in Wytham Woods near Oxford were made at intervals of 5 weeks for 17 months. In 2 autumns estimates were made also of the relative volumes of the different foods eaten by these species on 4 other areas in the same woods. Wood mice were mainly seedeaters but when seeds were scarce in the spring and early summer they turned to arthropods or, when these were not abundant, to the buds or young shoots of green plants. There was little difference in diet between sexes, but very young individuals tended to eat less seed and a greater variety of foods than adults. Bank voles were almost wholly herbivorous, but ate large amounts of dead leaves in winter. Fleshy fruits were eaten when available as were seeds with a relatively soft testa. The leaves of woody plants were preferred to those of herbs, which were eaten in quantity only when the former were unavailable. Small quantities of fungi, roots, flowers, grass, moss, insects and worms were eaten also. There was little difference in diet between sexes. Young bank voles ate less seed and perhaps also less fruit than adults. Differences in diets of wood mice and bank voles were great enough to prevent competition for food between the species in habitats similar to those studied.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The feeding habits of the titmice, Treecreeper and Goldcrest were studied in a mixed broad‐leaved wood near Oxford, from April 1950 to August 1951, by means of repeated standard observations. The proportion of time spent feeding varied inversely with the body‐weight of the species. A greater proportion of the time was spent feeding in mid‐winter, and in the breeding season when young were being fed, than in spring or autumn. Feeding intensity varied similarly. Fighting for food was recorded most often in mid‐winter, and rarely in summer. Most attacks were intraspecific. Probably individuals gain or lose much food by fighting. Although adult birds search for food most of the time when feeding young, they preen then as often as at other times. The period and intensity of singing and calling was measured. This was often performed concurrently with other activities–mainly feeding–in the tits, least often by Great Tits, most often by Coal Tits. Distant flight was more often recorded in winter than in summer. The frequency with which the birds fed a in different species of trees and shrubs, and (6) at different feeding stations, varied significantly from month to month. The behaviour of the birds is described. The Parus species fed most diversely in autumn, and least diversely in early summer. Coal and Marsh Tits fed more diversely than Great and Blue Tits, which in turn fed more diversely than Longtailed Tits and Goldcrests. The tit species were more distinctly segregated from each other by feeding habit in winter than in summer. Food was especially short in mid‐winter and in the breeding season, and competition for food was most severe in mid‐winter. Hence mortality from food shortage is probably more density‐dependent in winter than in summer. Although the several tit species have much in common, and often eat the same foods, each species has evolved characteristic methods of feeding, with corresponding structural adaptations; and each species occupies a more or less distinct feeding‐niche.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The breeding biology of Parus major and P. caeruleus was studied in 1947–49 in a mixed deciduous wood, near Oxford, in which 200 nestboxes were erected (density about two per acre).  The combined Great and Blue Tit population rose from about 43 pairs in 1947 (following a very severe winter) to about 100 pairs in 1948, and about 135 pairs in 1949. Of these, nearly all the Great Tits and about two‐thirds of the Blue Tits nested in the boxes.  Pre‐nesting behaviour is briefly described; hole inspecting and courtship feeding were observed. The average time taken to build a nest differed in each season; both species built many more nests than were used for laying.  The breeding dates differed by two to three weeks in different years. The exact season is linked to the brief period of abundance of the larvae of Cheimatobia brumata and Hibernia defoliaria, on which the nestlings are largely fed. The seasonal rise and fall in the larval abundance were estimated by measuring the volume of faecal pellets from the larvae.  The average clutch‐size differed significantly from year to year. Clutches laid early in the season were on average larger than those laid later. Repeat clutches were smaller than first clutches, and genuine second clutches were smaller still.  Individual egg‐weights of the Great Tit ranged from 1.3 to 2.2 grams, and averaged 1.75 grams (no significant difference between years). Eggs from average‐sized clutches were heavier than those from very small or very large clutches. The first four to six eggs laid in a clutch tended to be successively heavier, but in general eggs in each clutch tended to be of similar weight. Clutches of the Blue Tit were weighed in one year only; the average individual egg‐weight was 1.11 grams.  Incubation tended to begin earlier, in relation to clutch completion, in late nests than in early ones. The mean incubation period of the Great Tit was 13.9 days, and of the Blue Tit 14.2 days.  The mean growth rates of Great Tits differed significantly in 1948 and 1949. The growth curve of Blue Tits is similar to that of the Great Tit.  Members of large‐sized broods averaged significantly lighter than members of small‐sized broods, and second‐brood nestlings were lighter than first‐brood nestlings. Great Tit nestlings aged 14 1/2 days ranged in weight from 10.2 to 21.4 grams. Less than 1% of the nestlings in first broods died from starvation in the nest, but there were many losses in second broods.  Eggs laid after the start of incubation hatched later than the rest of the clutch. Late‐hatched nestlings averaged significantly lighter than the others.  Frequency of parents' visits to the nest increases with number in brood, but not proportionately. Hence a member of a small‐sized brood receives on average more food visits than a member of a large‐sized brood.  Feather development was independent of body‐weight, and is therefore a reliable indicator of age.  The mean nestling period of the Great Tit was 18.9 days, of the Blue Tit 19.7 days.  When losses due to man are excluded, the breeding success was about 90% for each species.

Previously unpublished results from these plots are used to describe the structure and composition of the wood. 21 quadrats were re-recorded in 1984. Changes in these plots in the intervening period are described. Between 1973 and 1976, 163 quadrats were laid out in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, to test a system for the long-term surveillance of British woodland vegetation (Dawkins & Field 1978). (Most of the recording took place in 1974 and for convenience this date only is used to refer to this work.) This paper uses unpublished results from these plots to examine the structure and composition of the wood and analyses changes in some of the plots 10 years later",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The distribution of woodland Isopods was debenned by ayatentically the various habitats of a broad-leaved wood in suzer and vinter; day and night. This work was done in Wytham estate. During the winter Trichoniscus pusillus, Philosola corus, and Oniagus asellus remain inactive to a large degree, while Porcellio scab shelters under the moss and bark on the trunks of oak, ash, and sycamor trees. When summer comes they disperse, T. pusillus going to the litter and dead wood, E. muncorus to the litter, E. scaber to the upper parts of the trees, and 0. ssella to the dead wood and base and upper parts of trees. P. scaber is thus found to be virtually a tree-dwelling Isop and this localisation of populations makes it an especially suitable animal for population research. Accordingly, work was concentrated on the seasonal changes in structure, size and behaviour of P. scaber populations, using a combin- ation of field and laboratory techniques. First the relationship of length of the female to number of young and Juveniles was determined from field material. It was found that the maber of eggs, and the manber of young carried in the brood-pouch increases linearly with length of the mother. However, the number of young was less than the washer of eggs by 20%, indicating a brood-pouch mortality of that amount. Then survival of the adults in the laboratory was measured under six conditions of density, and it was found that no change occurred in the survival rate either with age or denalty.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The work described in this thesis was undertaken as part of the research programme into bird populations carried out at the Edward Grey Institute, Oxford. The particular problem was whether lack of food might be an important factor control- ling the numbers of titmice (Paridae). This was tackled. indirectly, since it is usually impossible to measure the availability of food to birds in the field, even if the numbers of the birds and their food are known. Observations were made (a) on breeding biology from 1947-1951, and (b) on feeding behaviour in 1950 and 1951. The field-work was conducted in Marley Wood and adjacent parts of the University Estate at Wytham, Oxford. The habitat was of mixed broad- leaved trees, with a locally dense shrub layer and many open spaces. Oak was the dominant species of tree, with ash, birch, wych-elm, sycamore and beach also common. The shrub layer contained mainly elder, hazel, hawthorn and maple. Six members of the Paridae were resident: Great Tit Parus major, Blue Tit, P. caeruleus, Coal Tit Pater, Marsh Tit P. palustris, Willow Tit P. atricapillus and Longtailed Tit Aegithalos asudatus. The habitat was typical for all except the Coal Tit, which is primarily a bird of coniferous forest. The greatest number of tits was present immediately after the breeding season. The juveniles dispersed as soon as they were independent of their parents. Numbers fell steeply during July and August, then less steeply to a minimum in January-February; they then rose again slightly just before the breeding season. In the severe late winter of 1946/47, all Great and Blue Tits and about half the Marsh Tits disappeared from the wood. Many tits congregated round farmsteads, villages and the residential districts of Oxford. Some returned immediately after the thaw in mid-March. In the subsequent, rather mild winters, some of the Great and Blue Tits and a few Marsh Tits left the wood and returned in spring. This suggests that life in the woods in more rigorous in winter than elsewhere, and that the density of titmice staying in the woods partly depends on the severity of the weather. Conclusion: 1. The availability of food probably limits the number of young that can be reared. 2. Intraspecific competition for food is probably more severe in winter than in summer. Hence mortality due to food shortage in winter will be strictly density dependent, and may be critical in controlling population density. Heavy mortality among juvenile birds in late summer may be unimportant in the control of population density. 3. Each species occupies a different feeding niche. Interspecific competition for food is so reduced that five members of the genus Parus are able to live together in the same habitat.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The present study of Sparrowhawk feeding ecology assessed the effect of hawk predation on tit populations Parus spp. in Wytham Wood, Oxford in winter.  The resident winter Sparrowhawk population was estimated at 12 males and 13  females, based on trapping results. As the winter progressed, mean body weights of all age/sex categories declined, corresponding to declining food supplies. High body weights at the start of winter increased hawks!  chances of surviving the winter.  Radio telemetry of 26 hawks revealed large variations in range size both within and between age/sex categories. All hawks centred winter activities on their main roost-site, which corresponded to summer nest-sites in adult birds. All hawks preferred woodland for hunting and roosting, but females used farmland more than males, relating to their exploitation of different prey populations. Habitat edges were preferred for hunting by all hawks. Ranges overlapped widely both within and between age/sex categories. Four main hunting techniques were identified, with choice determined mainly by habitat. In each habitat, the most successful technique was used the most. Adults were more successful at hunting than juveniles. Hawks spent 25% of the day hunting, and 18% of observed attacks were successful. A peak of hunting behaviour was found in early morning, which corresponded to the timing of known kills (88% made before noon). Consumption of prey generally inhibited further hunting, and hawks responded to increasing hunger by increasing flight activity. Hunting was concentrated in high prey density areas, and prey were usually taken to cover prior to handling and consumption. The larger the prey the larger the consumption period, and some evidence indicated prey caching.  Hawk diet was dominated by songbirds (tits by number and thrushes and pigeons by weight). Diet composition varied with area, period and winter, reflecting changes in availability and distribution of Wytham avifauna. Factors affecting vulnerability of different prey species are discussed. An estimated 25-64% of each age category of the tit population were killed by hawks each winter. The effects of these losses on the structure of the tit breeding population is discussed. Selection of individual tits is analysed. Results indicated that different tit species were selected according to vulnerability, while no preference was shown for adult or Juveniles of either tit species.  Various aspects of the Sparrowhawk winter ecology are discussed, including: winter range and territoriality, foraging strategies, winter survival and the impact of hawk predation on tit populations.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The breeding biology of the Jackdaw was studied over three years in a population in Wytham woods (Oxfordshire). The density of nest-boxes were experimentally manipulated in order to study some simple ecological parameters of the breeding strategy of the Jackdaw in relation to nest distribution. This preliminary study indicated that breeding synchronisation, within a population of Jackdaws, does not vary between years and is not related to the nest density. Furthermore, Jackdaws did not seem to prefer either grouped or solitary nests, but, on the whole, the breeding success of birds that settled in the most isolated boxes was higher. The effect of various factors on the breeding biology of the Jackdaws, with regard to the brood reduction hypothesis, were investigated. 1- Factors influencing the patterns of egg variation. The intra-clutch variation of egg-size was consistent with the \"brood reduction hypothesis'; egg-size decreased with laying sequence and the difference between the last egg in the clutch and the clutch mean increased with clutch-size. The patterns of egg variation were rather constant, even when facing varying breeding conditions. 2- Factors influencing the length of incubation. There were no seasonal or yearly differences in hatching intervals, suggesting that incubation pattern is constant in Jackdaws. The incubation period decreased with laying order and hatching interval increased with clutch-size. The Jackdaws started incubation with the first egg and successful breeders incubated their eggs more efficiently than unsuccessful ones. Effect of egg-size variation and hatching asynchrony. The Jackdaws did not appear to modify their hatching interval in relation to changing environmental conditions. Pairs that increased quickly the weight differences in the brood fledged more young. Hatching asynchrony resulted in high and early mortality of the chicks which hatched from the last eggs in the clutch. The function of hatching asynchrony was experimentally tested by manipulating, during one year, the hatching intervals. Jackdaws appeared to have an 'optimal' level of hatching asynchrony and any deviation from it resulted in a slight decrease in their breeding success. Brood reduction was common in this study and took place later in synchronous broods. It can be concluded that Jackdaws hatch their eggs asynchronously in order to adjust the brood-size in the most efficient way. Lack's hypothesis seems to be the most likely explanation for hatching asynchrony in Jackdaws.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The direct effects on the environment of anthropogenically-induced habitat change through urbanisation, expansion of agriculture and the effects of the timber trade, among others, have been studied for many years at a range of spatial scales. Habitat degradation through overgrazing by herbivores, often seen as a zoogenic impact although associated problems often have their roots in human action, has also been studied. However, such studies are usually limited to the immediate effects on vegetation. Although it is increasingly recognised that impacts spread throughout the ecosystem, studies quantifying this have been limited. In this study the effects of woodland habitat change on the great tit Parus major are investigated in a small and isolated deciduous woodland outside Oxford, UK. Habitat change in this instance I° most notably a reduction of the ground and shrub layers by increasing deer populations. Data from two separate habitat surveys, carried out in 1974 (before the deer populations dramatically increased) and 1991 (when the populations were reaching their maxima and effects in the woodland were becoming visible), are used to infer levels of deer-related habitat degradation in a series of plots around the wood. Using great tit breeding data for the years around these surveys, collected and collated by the Edward Grey Institute for Field Ornithology Department of Zoology, Oxford University), levels of grazing are correlated with changes in the life-history strategies of the birds, reflected in several named breeding parameters. Although several possible correlations between habitat changes and changes in these breeding parameters are presented, only the relationship between habitat change and clutch size remained after multivariate analysis. That any response to habitat change was exhibited by such a generalist species, with such wide tolerance of habitat type, suggests that other species, particularly those with more specific ecologies, may also be affected by deer grazing. It is therefore suggested that until work at Wytham and elsewhere can identify and either disprove or mitigate for such effects, the current policy of deer management should continue. In many areas deer populations, particularly of muntjac Muntiacus reeves, have increased to the extent that they have become a danger to ecosystem stability; particular effort should be made to prevent this from becoming the case at Wytham. In the meantime, managers should be aware of the network of interactions within ecosystems and the potential for activities such as deer grazing to destabilise whole systems. Managers should be mindful of the non-obvious ecosystem interactions such as that exhibited here between deer and a bird species. Further investigation of the nestbox data assessed variations attributable to the altitude and aspect of the nestboxes. Although the altitudinal gradient at Wytham is not large, it is suggested that the great tit may exhibit a response to it. Such a conclusion is drawn tentatively. A surprising effect of slope aspect on nestbox choice is also reported and discussed. It is proposed that more work could be carried out in a similar area to this project. The great tit has a very wide habitat tolerance and while little effect was discernible from the extant datasets, anecdotal effects of deer populations elsewhere suggest that effects on other small animals should be assessed. This will help develop a better understanding of the way non-obvious interactions filter through ecosystems and broaden our general understanding of woodland and other processes. The study aimed to compare breeding parameters of great tit at two different time periods to assess possible correlation with habitat degradation caused by deer before and after a major deer cull.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The direct effects on the environment of anthropogenically-induced habitat change through urbanisation, expansion of agriculture and the effects of the timber trade, among others, have been studied for many years at a range of spatial scales. Habitat degradation through overgrazing by herbivores, often seen as a zoogenic impact although associated problems often have their roots in human action, has also been studied. However, such studies are usually limited to the immediate effects on vegetation. Although it is increasingly recognised that impacts spread throughout the ecosystem, studies quantifying this have been limited. In this study the effects of woodland habitat change on the great tit Parus major are investigated in a small and isolated deciduous woodland outside Oxford, UK. Habitat change in this instance I° most notably a reduction of the ground and shrub layers by increasing deer populations. Data from two separate habitat surveys, carried out in 1974 (before the deer populations dramatically increased) and 1991 (when the populations were reaching their maxima and effects in the woodland were becoming visible), are used to infer levels of deer-related habitat degradation in a series of plots around the wood. Using great tit breeding data for the years around these surveys, collected and collated by the Edward Grey Institute for Field Ornithology Department of Zoology, Oxford University), levels of grazing are correlated with changes in the life-history strategies of the birds, reflected in several named breeding parameters. Although several possible correlations between habitat changes and changes in these breeding parameters are presented, only the relationship between habitat change and clutch size remained after multivariate analysis. That any response to habitat change was exhibited by such a generalist species, with such wide tolerance of habitat type, suggests that other species, particularly those with more specific ecologies, may also be affected by deer grazing. It is therefore suggested that until work at Wytham and elsewhere can identify and either disprove or mitigate for such effects, the current policy of deer management should continue. In many areas deer populations, particularly of muntjac Muntiacus reeves, have increased to the extent that they have become a danger to ecosystem stability; particular effort should be made to prevent this from becoming the case at Wytham. In the meantime, managers should be aware of the network of interactions within ecosystems and the potential for activities such as deer grazing to destabilise whole systems. Managers should be mindful of the non-obvious ecosystem interactions such as that exhibited here between deer and a bird species. Further investigation of the nestbox data assessed variations attributable to the altitude and aspect of the nestboxes. Although the altitudinal gradient at Wytham is not large, it is suggested that the great tit may exhibit a response to it. Such a conclusion is drawn tentatively.

This study aimed to identify early effects of trampling on vegetation in an ancient woodland Wytham wood was chosen as the site to study the effects of low intensity trampling levels on the woodland ground flora  Data on percentage cover of species, soil pH and light intensity readings were collected from twelve transects. Six of the transects were taken across footpaths and six in secluded areas for comparison  TWINSPAN analysis was used to classify samples in terms of the species they contained and Canonical Correspondence analysis was used to plot samples and species with the environmental variables to see if there was any correlation Simple linear regression and multiple regression were employed to look for a linear relationship between distance from footpaths (and therefore trampling) and species richness.  The results failed to find an increase in species richness with increasing distance from footpaths or a change in composition reflected along all the footpath transects. The TWINSPAN analysis did however, identify a different composition of species in secluded areas in contrast to areas near footpaths. The Canonical Correspondence analysis and the regression failed to find a strong relationship between composition and the environmental variables which leaves the pattern identified by TWINSPAN open to other influences.  The study concludes that although no evidence was found to show a change in vegetation at the impacted site, the overall contrast in species composition between the two areas is due to the presence of footpaths, although this can not be directly attributed to trampling because varying intensity levels were not considered in this study.

This thesis is concerned mainly with the population dynamics of Agonum fuliginosum, a species found abundantly in many marches and fans, but also contains descriptions of the life histories and habitat distributions of some of the other \"wet\" species. The population dynamics of A. fuliginosum were studied at a march in Wytham Woods (Berkshire) and at two other marshes in the grounds of Blenheim Palace (Oxfordshire). Sampling methods included pitfall trapping, hand collecting and random sampling of the marsh litter and special hibernation sites (sallow logs). The habitat distributions of the species were studied at the above marshes and by sampling over 30 other \"wet\" habitats, sainly by pitfall trapping and hand collecting. Information on life histories came from beetles collected from most of these sources. The study aimed to describe the changes in numbers of Carabidae",

The work has been done by members of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology under the direction of Dr. Lack. The study was initiated 16 years ago and has been carried out primarily on the Great Tit and, to a lesser extent, on the Blue Tit in Wytham Wood and also on these two species and the Coal Tit in other places. Ky om study was made primarily in Wytham but also to some extent in Oxford gardens as well.  Some basic data on the tits in Wytham and their movements are given. There is good evidence that the great majority of the birds do not leave the wood, so that the population can be treated as self- contained. Work was done on a much larger scale than before and a new trapping technique was employed which resulted in larger ambers of tits being caught. In addition, it was discovered that it was possible to distinguish by plumage between yearling and older Great Tits and hence to compare the nesting behaviour and survival of these two age groups.  Evidence is provided which suggests that the size of clutch a tit lays is, in part, influenced by the immediate surroundings of the nest: the birds lay larger clutches in areas where there are many large trees and smaller ones where there are few large trees. On the day of hatching some young were taken from one neat and put in another. This made it possible to collect many more data, than were previously available, on the fate of unusually large and small broods. It is shown that the weight of the young varies markedly with their brood-size, with the time of season at which the young hatch, and with habitat, young being heavier in all broods than in large ones, in early broods than in late ones and in woodland than in gardens.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"This study forms part of a long term project on the investigation of the factors affecting populations of tits. The work has been done by members of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology under the direction of Dr. Lack. The study was initiated 16 years ago and has been carried out primarily on the Great Tit and, to a lesser extent, on the Blue Tit in Wytham Wood and also on these two species and the Coal Tit in other places. Ky om study was made primarily in Wytham but also to some extent in Oxford gardens as well.  Some basic data on the tits in Wytham and their movements are given. There is good evidence that the great majority of the birds do not leave the wood, so that the population can be treated as self- contained. Work was done on a much larger scale than before and a new trapping technique was employed which resulted in larger ambers of tits being caught. In addition, it was discovered that it was possible to distinguish by plumage between yearling and older Great Tits and hence to compare the nesting behaviour and survival of these two age groups.  Evidence is provided which suggests that the size of clutch a tit lays is, in part, influenced by the immediate surroundings of the nest: the birds lay larger clutches in areas where there are many large trees and smaller ones where there are few large trees. On the day of hatching some young were taken from one neat and put in another. This made it possible to collect many more data, than were previously available, on the fate of unusually large and small broods. It is shown that the weight of the young varies markedly with their brood-size, with the time of season at which the young hatch, and with habitat, young being heavier in all broods than in large ones, in early broods than in late ones and in woodland than in gardens.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Between November 1963 and March 1966 the changes in numbers and survival of bank voles (Clethrionoeye glareolus) and of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) were studied, by live-trapping and marking the animals individually, on two 4.2 more (1.7 ha.) areas within a 65 acre (26 ha.) mixed deciduous wood at Wytham naar Oxford. Both areas sampled essentially the same populations. Bank voles were extremely abundant in late 1963 but declined in numbers rapidly during the winter of 1963-64 to reach a low density in the spring. Numbers remained low during the next eighteen months but rose again in the autumn of 1965. The role the food supply played in repressing a recovery in numbers during the first breeding season after the decline was investigated experimentally, by adding cats to a 3.6 nors (1.5 he.) area near one of the original trapping areas. There was no apparent difference between the survival of voles on the two areas, nor was the increase in numbers on the experimental area more marked than on the nearby area used as a control. It was therefore concluded that the continuing low numbers were not the result of a deficient food supply. The relative changes in numbers of wood mice recorded during this study were compared with those obtained in other studies at Wytham during the past eighteen years. This revealed the presence of three distinct types of yearly curve in the changes in numbers present, one of which occurred only once.",

II:  From analysis of accumulated data:  4) To what extent can the population changes outside the breeding season be broken down by age structure and into dynamic processes, such as immigration, emigration and mortality?  5) How are the distinguishable dynamic processes influenced by density and environmental processes such as the weather conditions and the Beech crop? 6) How does the population composition change during the year, outside the breeding season; what is the timing of mortality, immigration and dispersal? 7) By the construction of a model of Great Tit dynamics in Wytham, to test how Important the relations emerging from the analysis are in determining the observed population behaviour. 8) How do Great Tit dynamics compare with other species; how does the present research influence hypotheses concerning the regulation of Great Tit dynamics?",

Some of these areas have since been damaged or destroyed, but mosa intervening land has reverted to broadleaved woodland from arable land, old pasture, open common grazing and wood-pasture. In 1986, each area of ancient woodland and each other area of secondary woodland with a distinct history was searched from March to September for vascular plant species regarded by the Conservancy Council (NCC) South Region as 'ancient woodland indicators'. There were 72 such species in Wytham. Most individual species were 'indicators' only in the sense that they were commoner in ancient woodland than outside it. Three species had colonised a five-year old arable field and four others were commoner, or only found, outside ancient woodland. Two-hundred-year-old secondary woodland contained only slightly fewer species on the regional indicator list than ancient woodland, Thus, the list of relatively common species completely restricted to ancient woodland in Wytham was not the same as comparable list for NCC South region as a whole. A previously overlooked ancient woodland patch was identified by using the regional list. A high concentration of 'ancient woodland indicators' in a small area prompted a search of historical records which revealed references to a wood in the right area. The spread of many 'indicator species' into secondary woodland in Wytham suggests cautious optimism for their conservation and for the restoration of some features of ancient woods in other areas.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"In 1800, Wytham Woods contained 13-14 discrete patches of ancient semi woodland. Some of these areas have since been damaged or destroyed, but mosa intervening land has reverted to broadleaved woodland from arable land, old pasture, open common grazing and wood-pasture. In 1986, each area of ancient woodland and each other area of secondary woodland with a distinct history was searched from March to September for vascular plant species regarded by the Conservancy Council (NCC) South Region as 'ancient woodland indicators'. There were 72 such species in Wytham. Most individual species were 'indicators' only in the sense that they were commoner in ancient woodland than outside it. Three species had colonised a five-year old arable field and four others were commoner, or only found, outside ancient woodland. Two-hundred-year-old secondary woodland contained only slightly fewer species on the regional indicator list than ancient woodland, Thus, the list of relatively common species completely restricted to ancient woodland in Wytham was not the same as comparable list for NCC South region as a whole. A previously overlooked ancient woodland patch was identified by using the regional list. A high concentration of 'ancient woodland indicators' in a small area prompted a search of historical records which revealed references to a wood in the right area. The spread of many 'indicator species' into secondary woodland in Wytham suggests cautious optimism for their conservation and for the restoration of some features of ancient woods in other areas.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"In 1800, Wytham Woods contained 13-14 discrete patches of ancient semi woodland. Some of these areas have since been damaged or destroyed, but mosa intervening land has reverted to broadleaved woodland from arable land, old pasture, open common grazing and wood-pasture. In 1986, each area of ancient woodland and each other area of secondary woodland with a distinct history was searched from March to September for vascular plant species regarded by the Conservancy Council (NCC) South Region as 'ancient woodland indicators'. There were 72 such species in Wytham. Most individual species were 'indicators' only in the sense that they were commoner in ancient woodland than outside it. Three species had colonised a five-year old arable field and four others were commoner, or only found, outside ancient woodland. Two-hundred-year-old secondary woodland contained only slightly fewer species on the regional indicator list than ancient woodland, Thus, the list of relatively common species completely restricted to ancient woodland in Wytham was not the same as comparable list for NCC South region as a whole. A previously overlooked ancient woodland patch was identified by using the regional list. A high concentration of 'ancient woodland indicators' in a small area prompted a search of historical records which revealed references to a wood in the right area. The spread of many 'indicator species' into secondary woodland in Wytham suggests cautious optimism for their conservation and for the restoration of some features of ancient woods in other areas.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"169 taxa, probably more than 80% of the mosses and liverworts in Wytham Wood have been recorded, mainly in 1990-1993. A list is also given of species previously recorded there and which have not been refound. On the basis of Dr. E. W. Jones’ Floras, some comments are made on changes in the bryophyte since these earlier records. The woods contain more species then most lowland words including several bryophytes uncommon in England. Its open [illegible] areas are refuges for species of a habitat which is decreasing nationally. It is therefore an important biological site so the conservation of its bryophtyes is discussed ",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. A description and vegetation analysis is given for a small area of limestone grassland by Wytham Wood, Berkshire. Three sampling areas are distinguished whose spider fauna was studied: (1) a Brachypodium pinnatum sward; (2) an area consisting mainly of Festuca rubra; and (3) a sparse and diverse vegetation on loose Coral Rag limestone. 2. Collecting and sampling methods are described including a platform temperature-gradient apparatus designed to extract the spider fauna from vegetation quadrat samples. 3. The dense Festuca turf supported more spiders (up to 841.9/m2) than Brachypodium, and both recorded higher population densities than the more varied vegetation on the Coral Rag limestone. The most uniform vegetation (Brachypodium) recorded the lowest mean number of species; the highest number was recorded on the Coral Rag where floristic diversity was greatest. 4. The proportion of adults in the spider population was never more than 48% during the year, being highest in the winter and lowest in late summer (<7% in July). the seasonal trends in population density and proportion of adults are similar in all three habitats. 5. A total of 141 species was recorded in the 2.8 acres (113.3 ares) of which 63% could be assigned to the ground zone. This total, which includes fifty-eight Linyphiidae, is nearly a quarter of the known British fauna. 6. Population interchange between the habitats appeared to take place easily, but within the same families the dominant species differed from habitat to habitat. 7. Examples are given of cryptic coloration in those spiders which hunt on the vegetation surface, mainly in the lower part of the field-layer. 8. The numbers of spiders taken in the traps in all three habitats showed a large peak in early summer (mainly Lycosidae) followed by a fall and subsidiary peak in the autumn (mainly Thomisidae), which is most pronounced in the Coral Rag vegetation and least in the Brachypodium. 9. Habitat preference in a number of common spiders is demonstrated both by trapping frequency and numbers recorded per unit area; both methods give the same picture of habitat selection. 10. Selective grazing and trampling by herbivores such as sheep are shown to influence population density and the micro-distribution of individual species.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"(1) The removal of adult male wood mice from a semi-isolated 1.2-ha area between late May and July in 1968 and until August in 1969 increased immigration/recruitment, improved juvenile and subadult survival and advanced the time of the expected autumn increase in numbers compared with a nearby 1.5-ha control area in continuous woodland. (2) Replicated field experiments showed that established residents hinder the settlement of immigrating adults. (3) Laboratory experiments showed that established adults may reduce the growth and survival of juveniles. (4) It is concluded that adult males hinder the recruitment of juveniles as well as immigration and so prevent numbers from increasing during most of the summer. (5) The role of females and the significance of variations in aggressive behaviour in population regulation have still to be elucidated.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"We report results from a continuing, long-term field experiment addressing biotic responses to climatic change in grasslands. We focus on effects of summer precipitation (enhanced rainfall, drought, control) and winter ground temperatures (warming, control) on growth, reproduction and herbivory in St John's wort, Hypericum perforatum L. Both winter warming and summer rainfall regimes modified performance and interactions of H. perforatum, particularly those with herbivorous insects. Winter warming had positive effects, with earlier initiation of plant growth and reduced damage by gall-forming and sucking insects in spring, but also had strong negative effects on plant height, flowering, and reproduction. Summer drought reduced reproductive success, but even severe drought did not affect plant growth or flowering success directly. Rather, summer drought acted indirectly by modifying interactions with herbivorous insects via increased vulnerability of the plants to herbivory on flowers and capsules. Overall, the effects of summer precipitation were expressed mainly through interactions that altered the responses to increased winter temperatures, particularly as summer drought increased. The field site, in Oxfordshire, UK, is near the northern limit of distribution of the species, and the experiment tested probable responses of H. perforatum as climates shift towards those more typical of the current center of the distribution of the species. However, if climates do change according to the projected scenarios, then H. perforatum is unlikely to fare well near its northern boundary. Increased winter temperatures, particularly if accompanied by increased summer drought, will probably render this species even less abundant in England than at present.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"An attempt has been made to outline the ecology of the weasel (Mustela nivalis L.) in Wytham Woods, near Oxford, with particular reference to its relationships with its principal prey (the two small rodents Clethrionomys glareolus Schreber and Apodemus sylvaticus L. and (at certain times of the year) birds of the family Paridae). Comparison was also made between the weasel and the tawny owl (Strix aluco L.); these two species together are the most Important predators in the wood. (Data on species other than the weasel were from the work of other members of this Department working in the same study area.) Field studies were carried out from March 1968 to June 1970, and were supported by laboratory analysis of the food of weasels in Wytham and elsewhere: background information on age structure and population dynamics was obtained by analysis of carcasses of weasels killed by gamekeepers. In Wytham during the study period (a time of \"normal\" small rodent numbers) the mean territory size of male weasels was 28 acres, and of females, 5-10 acres. A total of 25 weasels were marked on a study area of 67 acres, of which 10 were classified as residents. In all, 347 captures were recorded. The evidence suggested that even with these large territories, the weasels were short of food. An average of 6.9 hours were required for all the traps to be set at night before one caught a weasel, 8.9 hours by day. The food relationships of the Wytham weasels were analysed from 34 faecal samples: the main prey at all seasons was Clethrionomys, with a very marked increase in the numbers of birds and eggs taken in spring. Individual variations in diet could be explained in terms of the patterns of habitat types contained in each territory. The estimated rate of removal of Apodemus and Clethrionomys averaged 10% per month of each species. Weasels selected for Clethrionomys at high predation pressure (in winter) and it was only then that they were accounting for most of the observed mortality of the voles; they were responsible for a smaller proportion of the total mortality of Apodemus. There was no evidence that predation by weasels had any regulating effect on the small rodent populations, and this is probably correlated with the great complexity and stability of the habitat. The weasels and the tawny owls in Wytham appear to be ecologically separated by their activity patterns and food habits.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The mean year-class ratio in 6 samples of weasels (total n = 477) ranged from 59% to 84% young, and mean age from 0.79 to 1.16 yr. There was no difference in age structure between samples from 5 game estates and 1 reserve. Mean annual mortality of weasels of both sexes and all ages was 75-90%. In 12 pregnant weasels the mean number of embryos, observed from April to June, was 5.6. There was a definite anoestrous season in winter. Records of the number of weasels killed on game estates show that weasels and stoats reacted differently to the first outbreak of myxomatosis in England in 1954; and that weasel populations are capable of enormous sudden increases (usually associated with “mouse years”). These increases are probably due largely to summer litters produced by precocious juveniles, and also to some adults breeding a second time (both possibilities confirmed from ovarian histology on this material). Traditional gamekeeping practice may influence the seasonal pattern of mortality of weasels (highest in spring) but its effects are probably short-lived.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The interactions between woodland rodents (mainly wood mice, Apodemus sylvaticus, and bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus, but also including ecologically equivalent species of Peromyscus and Mus) and their predators are discussed at both the individual and the population level. The hunting techniques of predators, and the anti-predator defences of the rodents, determine which and how many rodents are killed. The effects of fluctuations in numbers of rodents on the biology of predators depend largely on the predator's hunting technique and life-history strategy. The effect of the combined force of predators on the population fluctuations of the rodents depends on whether their collective functional and numerical response is sufficiently extensive and rapid; this is greatly influenced by the supply of alternative prey and the heterogeneity of the habitat. In four case studies discussed, the impact of predation was considered to be substantial in all, but the apparent effects were opposite: in two it amplified and in the other two it minimised the population fluctuations of the rodents.

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. In 1974-76 164 permanent 10x10m plots were recorded at alternate intersections of a 100x100m grid in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire. Tree and shrub data were collected from all the plots in 1974-76, from 27 in 1984-85 and from all but one in 1991-92.  2. Changes in the structure and composition of the wood are assessed in terms of canopy cover, mean tree diameter, basal area and species occurrence.  3. The wood has become more open (reduced canopy cover) partly through management, partly natural processes such as windthrow and disease. The shrub cover has also declined greatly, probably because of increased deer browsing.  4. Most stands are predominantly young growth and for the wood as a whole mean tree  diameter, basal area and tree height have increased.  5. The overall composition of the wood has changed little, but there has been a significant decline in mean woody species number per plot from 5.8 to 4.1, mainly through declines in understorey species and young oak. Elm cover has been reduced by disease and birch also suffered preferentially from windthrow.  6. Variation in the composition of the plots was grouped into six broad classes using TWINSPAN analysis. These groupings in part reflect the differences in history and management of the woods which are a mixture of ancient and recent, semi-natural and planted stands.  7. The results are used to indicate gains and losses in nature conservation terms for the wood as a whole. The strengths and weaknesses of this system may hold lessons for future woodland monitoring exercises.  ",

The distribution of areas rich in earthworms, Lumbricus spp., is correlated with badger range size, whilst badger group size increases with the biomass of worms per badger territory and badger density increases with overall worm biomass. Regulation of badger density in an area is likely to take place through regulation of group size, in the absence of other factors such as persecution and lack of suitable sett‚Äêsites.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. The breeding population of the great tit in Marley Wood between 1947 and 1962 fluctuated between seven and eighty-six pairs. The fluctuations were mainly synchronous with those of the blue tit, and also with those of the great tit in other woods in England and Holland. 2. The commonest clutch was nine, and in most years the brood-size which on average resulted in most surviving juveniles was 9-10, though it varied in different years between five and fourteen. 3. Clutch-size and the production-rate of nestlings were slightly lower at higher breeding densities. They had no apparent influence on the fluctuations in the breeding population. 4. The critical factor determining the population fluctuations was the mortality of the juveniles between leaving the nest and the beginning of winter, probably mainly in June. This mortality was correlated with the ensuing beechmast crop, presumably because both were affected by certain conditions in summer. 5. Predation and disease seem to have been unimportant, and the evidence suggests that the breeding density was not limited by territorial behaviour. Hence the chief density-dependent factor was probably food shortage, but this could not be studied in the great tit in Marley; the coal tit was probably limited by its winter food in conifer plantations.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The Mammal Society has co‚Äêordinated a population survey of Wood Mice Apodemus sylvaticus and Bank Voles Clethrionomys glareolus in 13 0.81 ‚Äêhectare sites in Britain. Numbers of mice and voles live‚Äêtrapped using standard methods were collated every May/June and November/December from 1982 to 1987. The data were analysed with results from four independent studies in England and the corresponding assessments of tree seed crop size. Wood Mouse numbers are usually higher in winter than in summer but Bank Vole fluctuations are less regular. In deciduous woodland, Wood Mouse mean relative densities are significantly greater in the winter and the following summer after a good seed crop than after a poor one; rates of population change from summer to winter are significantly higher when a good seed crop falls. Bank Vole relative densities are significantly greater in the summer following a good seed crop than after a poor one, and rates of change from winter to summer are significantly higher. In Wood Mouse populations, tests for density dependence suggest that it is strong from summer to winter but absent from winter to summer; in Bank Voles weaker density dependence is present in both halves of the year. Thus, Wood Mouse numbers are regulated in autumn but are also influenced by seed crop size in winter and the following summer; Bank Vole numbers are less strongly regulated during both autumn and spring and are influenced by seed crop size in the following summer. Evidence is presented suggesting that populations of each species in deciduous woodlands are synchronized over the country in summer and that Wood Mice are also synchronized in winter; highs and lows tend to coincide between different sites. The yield of tree seed is shown to vary significantly from year to year and may be the cause of the synchrony, but weather effects may also be involved.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. Two populations of Agonum fuliginosum living in well-defined marsh habitats were studied from spring 1961 to spring 1963. Estimates of changes in relative or absolute abundance were obtained by a variety of collecting techniques but mainly by random quadrat sampling. Other populations of the same and other carabid species were studied cursorily. 2. There was a general pattern of adult mortality which was high during the breeding season (May to July), variable from July to winter and apparently low from early winter to spring. Maximum adult densities remained fairly constant during the study period, but there were considerable differences in maximum adult density among the various populations. 3. Indirect estimates of egg-production, larval numbers and food supply were obtained in the two main populations, and of egg production in some of the other populations. The amount of egg production varied from population to population and year to year. Differences between the densities of the new generation of adults in the two main populations closely reflected preceding differences between them in egg production and larval abundance. The amount of egg production was directly related to food supply in those populations where estimates of both were available. 4. Evidence from a field enclosure experiment together with negative evidence from a consideration of other potential mortality factors suggests that the high adult mortality in the breeding season was due largely to predation, probably by small mammals. The hypoThesis, that the survival of old generation females from early July to winter is inversely related to the amount of breeding they have done, was tested in natural and experimental populations, and corroborated, though it is not clear what aspects of reproduction influence survival. 5. It is not known what determined the adult densities in any population, though it appears that weather and interspecific competition can be discounted. The possibility of food-limitation in some populations cannot be rejected but it was not universal. High survival of old adults from one breeding season to the next was important in some populations. 6. The observed stability of the population is thought to be in part a reflection of the stability of some aspects of their habitat but in addition was enhanced by an intrinsic stabilizing mechanism involving the increased survival of old adults following poor breeding.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. An Australian fungus beetle, Cis bilamellatus, is a very important destroyer of dead birch bracket fungi (Polyporus betulinus) and other tree fungi in the lowlands of southern Britain. 2. Fungus fruiting-bodies are small, scattered, fairly temporary habitats which can be destroyed completely by their fauna. 3. In 1957-58 a study was made of the Cis bilamellatus populations of ten 1956-grown, one 1955-grown and one 1954-grown brackets of Polyporus betulinus on two birch trees in Wytham Woods, Berkshire. 4. The adult beetles, with a significantly higher proportion of female female than of male male, first colonized the newly dead brackets in the spring, the sex ratio remaining biased in favour of female female until the first filial generation appeared, and later not differing from 1:1. The dying fungi on the older tree tended to be colonized earlier and by larger numbers of beetles than those on the younger tree. 5. A value of the geometric rate of increase `r' of 0.0256+-0.0015 per head per day was found for four Cis bilamellatus populations growing in Polyporus betulinus in the laboratory at 24 degrees C and c. 66% R.H. This was found to agree remarkably well with a value calculated for the probable rate of increase of the population of one fungus in the field (r = 0.0207) between May and July when the mean daily temperature was only 15.2 degrees C. 6. The population changes throughout the first year are followed in the two fungi sampled most often over the longest period. After the initial immigration period, there was a fairly sudden increase in numbers by births, followed by a gentle decrease during the rest of the year, but this decline in numbers cannot be accounted for by any of the known causes of mortality, viz: the two known `predators' of larvae (a Cecidomyiid fly larva and the larva of a Bethylid wasp), interspecific competition with other Ciidae and Dipterous larvae, intraspecific competition or even low winter temperatures (which in really severe winters such as that of 1962-63 can kill the whole population). 7. There is evidence for emigration occurring in the autumn and winter as well as the spring movement which originally gave rise to the populations studied. Such emigration of newly matured adults would account completely for the annual post-breeding decline in the first and later years. 8. In the 1955-grown (and therefore second-year) fungus, the overall population picture for Cis bilamellatus was the same as in the first-year fungi except that the Bethylid wasp had been rather more abundant; in the 1954-grown (and therefore third-year) fungus the picture was again similar to that in the first-year fungi, except that other species of Ciidae were more abundant, and the C. bilamellatus population of this fungus had suffered an extremely heavy mortality, probably from low temperatures in the winter of 1955-56. 9. It was probably because of this heavy mortality that the third-year fungus lasted so long, i.e. up to the beginning of its fourth year, as a habitat and food for Ciidae. Both the second-year and third-year fungi were in 1957-58 becoming eaten out and, by then, competition for their remaining food and space must have been strong among the fungivorous insects. 10. It is considered that the density-independent mortality caused by low temperatures in a severe winter can only delay the effects of competition among the fungivorous insects (mainly C. bilamellatus in the area studied) for a limited and consumable resource such as the dead fruiting-bodies of Polyporus betulinus, and that an additional factor in the population regulation of this beetle species over a wide area is probably an overall scarcity of this habitat compared with the numbers of emigrating beetles.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"We analysed trends in vegetation monitored at regular intervals over the past two decades (1993-2012) at the twelve terrestrial Environmental Change Network (ECN) sites. We sought to determine the extent to which flora had changed and link any such changes to potential environmental drivers. We observed significant increases in species richness, both at a whole network level, and when data were analysed within Broad Habitat groupings representing the open uplands, open lowlands and woodlands. We also found comparable increases in an indicator of vegetation response to soil pH, Ellenberg R. Species characteristic of less acid soils tended to show more consistent increases in frequency across sites relative to species with a known tolerance for strongly acidic soils. These changes are, therefore, broadly consistent with a response to increases in soil solution pH observed for the majority of ECN sites that, in turn, are likely to be driven by large reductions in acid deposition in recent decades. Increases in species richness in certain habitat groupings could also be linked to increased soil moisture availability in drier lowland sites that are likely to have been influenced by a trend towards wetter summers in recent years, and possibly also to a reduction in soil nitrogen availability in some upland locations. Changes in site management are also likely to have influenced trends at certain sites, particularly with respect to agricultural practices. Our results are therefore indicative of widescale responses to major regional-scale changes in air pollution and recent weather patterns, modified by local management effects. The relative consistency of management of ECN sites over time is atypical of much of the wider countryside and it is therefore not appropriate to scale up these observations to infer national scale trends. Nevertheless the results provide an important insight into processes that may be operating nationally. It will now be necessary to test for the ubiquity of these changes using appropriate broader spatial scale survey data.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Methiocarb is a carbamate molluscicide widely used in pelleted form. Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus are commonly found in arable fields and will eat methiocarb pellets. Two previous field studies on the impacts on arable wood mice of broadcasting methiocarb pellets produced contrasting results, the number of mice being temporarily reduced in one but not the other. The season of application is also likely to influence the degree of impact on populations but the previous trials were both in autumn. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects on wood mice of broadcast applications of methiocarb in both autumn and spring and to determine whether depression of brain and serum cholinesterase (ChE) activity, a biomarker of exposure, could be detected in mice alive on treated fields after application. In trials carried out in October 1994 and April 1995, there were decreases in the number of wood mice on arable fields following pesticide application. The October decline (78%) was greater than that in April (33%), even though the activity of the mice appeared to be more heavily centred on the hedgerows, where pellets were not applied, in the autumn. Despite the reductions in numbers, no depression of ChE activity was detected in mice captured alive after application, suggesting that either exposed animals were not captured or that reactivation of ChE activity was rapid. This study confirmed that broadcast application of methiocarb can reduce wood mouse populations on arable fields. It also demonstrated that such effects can occur irrespective of season and that measurement of ChE activity in mice trapped after application may fail to indicate that exposure of the population has occurred.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. A large-scale field experiment was used to evaluate two contrasting grass leys in terms of nature conservation value, productivity and ease of management. The leys were suitable either for green cover on land removed from arable production (as part of Set-Aside or similar schemes) or for low-input agriculture or amenity uses. 2. One ley was a conventional mixture of cultivars of Phleum pratense L. (timothy or cat's-tail), Lolium perenne L. (ryegrass) and Trifolium repens L. (white clover). The other was a more species-rich mixture, based on 19th century 'herbal' leys. It comprised six indigenous grasses and three forbs and excluded L. perenne and T. repens. 3. The leys were managed both as hay and silage and were grown both with and without the appropriate fertilizer applications. 4. Over a three-year period the more species-rich ley retained more sown species and accommodated more naturally regenerating species than the conventional ley. Loss of sown species increased at high fertilizer levels. Numbers of both sown and naturally regenerating species were lower under the silage than the hay cutting regime. These results are discussed in relation to the relative dominance of sown species. 5. The more species-rich ley was also less productive and consequently easier to manage by infrequent mowing. 6. We conclude that carefully selected but simple mixtures of indigenous grasses and forbs are likely to satisfy a diverse range of management requirements, whilst at the same time benefiting wildlife and visual amenity in the wider countryside. Key recommendations are emboldened in the Discussion.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"(1) Six‚Äêmonthly trappings (summer and winter) were done between 1952 and 1969 of Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and Bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) in Wytham Woods, near Oxford. One hundred and fifty Longworth live traps were used on two 2‚Äêacre grids in oak‚Äêash‚Äêsycamore woodland. (2) The traps were pre‚Äêbaited for 48 hours and then set. The catch was examined on the evening of the same day and on the following morning. The total of animals caught during the 24 hours was used as an index to the actual numbers present. Animals retrapped in the morning (identified by a simple method of marking) were omitted from the total. (3) Between 1969 and 1972 the same procedure was used but trapping, evening and morning, was continued for 3‚Äê4more days until some 75-80% of the catch consisted of marked animals. (4) This enabled estimates to be made of the actual numbers of voles and mice present at each trapping and so to assess the proportion of the total present which was caught ring the first 24 hours. (5) These estimates were made by (Method la) a straight Lincoln Index, (Method lb) a Lincoln Index method as modified by Hayne (1949) and (Method 2) by Hayne's trap‚Äêout method. Over six trappings the estimates by these methods showed reasonable agreement. (6) Comparison of the index trapping (i.e. the numbers caught during the first 24 hours) with the estimates of the total numbers present showed that, on all occasions, more than half of the mice and voles present entered the traps during the first 24 hours. With Bank voles there was a tendency for about half of them to be trapped during this time during the winter and about three‚Äêquarters of them during the summer. (7) With Wood mice the figures are more variable but, again, never less than half were trapped during the first 24 hours and, on some occasions, nearly the whole of the population. (8) These results show that reasonably accurate estimates of the numbers of these rodents can be achieved within 3-4 days' trapping (estimates that can be cross‚Äêchecked by different methods) by using a high density of traps (see (1) above). Furthermore, trapping for 24 hours only will always catch at least half of the population present and, on occasions, considerably more than half.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. Parallel population studies were done on a predator, the tawny owl (Strix aluco), and on its two main prey species, the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) in deciduous woodland on the Wytham Estate, near Oxford, from October 1954 to August 1956. 2. The study area of 260 ac (104 ha), in Wytham Great Wood, contained a trapping grid of 120 ac (49 ha) on which, approximately every 2 months, mice and voles were caught, marked with numbered metal leg-rings and released. On this area the tawny owl population, consisting of eleven pairs, was censused and their breeding success recorded; only two of them had territories entirely within the trapping grid. 3. The territorial boundaries of these owls were mapped from observations made at dusk. A check on the observations was rendered possible by searching for pellets regurgitated by the owls and containing the indigestible parts of their prey, including marking rings. Of 1992 rodents marked, 160 were traced subsequently in pellets. 4. Since the home ranges of the rodents are small, the distribution of the locations where the recovered rings had originally been put on the prey delimits the areas in which each pair of owls hunted. The territory boundaries indicated from these data show very close agreement with the boundaries plotted from observations. This confirmed the validity of the observational method, which was being used for long-term census work on the whole estate (1000 ac, 405 ha). 5. A map of the trapping grid was prepared in terms of four categories of density of ground vegetation, ranging from almost bare ground under heavy canopy, where hunting is easy, to ground covered with a dense and high growth of bracken and bramble where hunting would be very difficult. 6. The trapping results showed that about five wood mice per ac were caught in each of the cover categories. The catches of bank voles were of this order in the barest covertype but increased with density of vegetation until they were three times as numerous in the thick bracken-bramble cover. 7. The recovery of marking rings from owl pellets showed that the owls caught bank voles in the four cover-types in the same proportions as did the traps. However, of wood mice they caught proportionately many more than the traps on the bare areas and many less than the traps in the densely vegetated areas. There was no evidence of selection by the owls between the sexes or size classes of the prey. 8. These results suggest that owl territories with plenty of bare ground will provide conditions for the most successful hunting when wood mice are abundant, whereas the territories in which the intermediate cover types predominate will be better when bank voles are abundant. 9. During the period of study both species of prey were scarce in the 1955 breeding season, whereas in the 1956 season the voles had increased in numbers markedly, the wood mice only slightly. 10. In 1955 only two pairs of tawny owls on the area studied even attempted to breed, though both fledged young successfully. In 1956 seven pairs attempted to breed, of which three fledged young. Breeding performance is a sensitive index to availability of prey in spring. 11. A comparison of breeding performance in these 2 years with features of each territory suggests that, in addition to the level of prey density, other characteristics, viz. territory size, the distribution of ground cover, and the previous experience of territory owners all contribute significantly to breeding success.",

The population dynamics of the woodlice Philoscia muscorum (Scopoli) and Trichoniscus pusillus pusillus (Brandt) living in limestone grassland in Wytham Woods, Berkshire, were studied between March 1964 and March 1966. 2. Densities of over 2000/m2 were found for Trichoniscus at the height of the breeding season. Minimal figures before recruitment were 830 in 1964 and 495 a year later. Figures for Philoscia were generally very much less than these. 3. The total live weight of Trichoniscus was greater than that of Philoscia in the spring of 1964 and 1966, but the position was reversed in 1965. 4. Size structure analysis showed the Trichoniscus population to have been severely affected by the drought of 1964. Growth and breeding almost ceased. Initially in the following year recruitment was very poor, because few animals had matured, but later good growth and recruitment largely re-established the pre-drought size structure, numbers and biomass. Philoscia showed none of these reactions to drought conditions. 5. The two breeding seasons in Philoscia were short and did not vary. In Trichoniscus they were long and very different, with an April breeding peak in 1964 and twin peaks in May and August during 1965. 6. Embryo production in Trichoniscus was 5847/m2 in 1964 and 2390 in 1965. Figures estimated for Philoscia were 219/m2 and 284 respectively. 7. Mortality of Trichoniscus juveniles was greater in 1964 than 1965, but the drought was not the cause. In this species life expectancy fell sharply on completion of breeding. Juvenile mortality was severe in both species. Mortality decreased exponentially in Philoscia, but in Trichoniscus the pattern was more complex. 8. Trichoniscus survived the drought by vertical migration deep into the soil, while Philoscia stayed within sampling range, seeming to have a physiological tolerance of extreme conditions. Size alone cannot explain this difference in behaviour. 9. In Trichoniscus there are indications of compensatory mechanisms tending to maintain a characteristic size structure and some stability of numbers and biomass. Philoscia showed numerical stability but biomass fell by 50% during the period of study.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The effects of cereal harvesting on the ecology of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were investigated at three arable study sites in Oxfordshire from 1987 to 1991 using both radio-tracking and live-trapping methodologies. The process of harvesting itself had little direct effect on the mice, but the removal of the cover afforded by the crop greatly increased predation pressure on the mice. After harvest, mice either emigrated from the arable ecosystem or reduced activity. Nevertheless, over half (17 of 32) of the mice radio-collared before harvest were taken by predators in the first week following harvest. Together with emigration, this produced an 80% decrease in the population. Post-harvest activities such as stubble burning subsequently further increased mortality. The dramatic increase in prey availability may benefit predators of small mammals in the cereal ecosystem such as tawny owls Strix aluco and weasels Mustela nivalis.",

Rubus fruticosus agg. (bramble) has declined greatly in abundance, probably because of browsing by deer. Some plots show large declines in ground flora diversity as plantations have grown and the canopy has closed; other plots have increased in richness where rides have been widened. There is a need for more long-term studies of woodland to separate cyclical changes in local species occurrence from long-term changes in a wood as a whole.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"1. The twenty-one British species of harvestmen have all been found in the Oxford district with the exception of Nelima silvatica. Seventeen of them have been found in Wytham Woods, Berkshire, where the main research was done. 2. There are three main types of life history found among the harvestmen. They may be found all the year round and have an overlap of the generations (e.g. Nemastoma lugubre); or they may be annuals which die before their eggs hatch. Of the annuals some hatch in the autumn and overwinter as immature forms (e.g. Platybunus triangularis and Megabunus diadema); others, including the majority of species, emerge in the spring and die off at the end of the autumn. 3. The numbers of harvestmen are never very large. In June, a maximum number of approximately 50 may be found in a square metre ground layer in deciduous woodland. The maximum biomass is found in July when there were more than 200 mg. of harvestmen per square metre in this habitat. 4. There are three main woodland species in Wytham Woods: Nemastoma lugubre found on the ground layer, Oligolophus tridens on the ground and field layer and Leiobunum rotundum on the tree trunks. 5. There is usually microhabitat separation in space and time, or both, of closely allied species of the same genus. 6. Harvestmen are most active at night. This activity is correlated with the decrease in light intensity, increase in relative humidity and decrease in temperature in the wood. 7. L. rotundum leaves the tree trunks at night and feeds on the field layer. It hunts on the under surface of Mercurialis perennis leaves. 8. There was found to be a strong correlation between the humidity preference of the species as tested in the laboratory and their stratification in oak woodland.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"A survey of ditches of Wytham Hill SSSI. 1. The survey has confirmed that the botanical interest of the fields is restricted to 5a and 13a. The justification for including other fields within the SSSI is their value as a \"buffer zone\" protecting the quality of the water flowing into the ditches. 2. The western boundary is illogical: ditch section la contains Hottonia and many of the other species found further east within the SSSI. The boundary cats straight across a field. We suggest that all of ditch 1 should be included. If Field 2a on the eastern edge is also to be included a detailed survey of this is required, but the information presently available suggests that the field is of only limited interest. 3. There is variation in the composition and structure of the plant communities found along different ditch sections which is related to the ditch size and its recent management history. 4. We believe that there is a case for cleaning out Ditch 4 to maintain the cyclical succession from open conditions to dense emergents which is a feature of ditch systems. The best way and time to do this would need to be discussed as well as whether some of the tributary ditches should be cleaned at the same time. 5. We cannot say whether management of the fields or ditches and particularly any recent changes in management have had a significant effect on the nature conservation value of the site. We did note minor damage to a thirty metre section of the north bank of Ditch 5 resulting from careless straw burning in field 4. This field has now been sown to grass but may be returned to cereals in a few years time",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Between November 1963 and October 1965 the long distance movements of Bank voles and Wood mice within an almost isolated 26 ha deciduous woodlot were studied by live trapping at approximately monthly intervals. Dispersal was most marked in juvenile Bank voles where most of the males and about half the females under 13 g, when released and later recaptured, had dispersed. Dispersal of juvenile Wood mice did not occur after September, before which time the evidence was sparse and inconclusive. It was estimated that about 6% of adult maleand 2% of adult female Bank voles dispersed. Little dispersal of adult Wood mice took place. The term `transient' is discussed. True transients in the ‚Äúonce‚Äêcaught' category are thought to be few. There was no evidence that the trappable population of either species included a significant number of non‚Äêresident individuals.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"(1) Changes in two populations of Neophilaenus lineatus (L.) near to the edge of their range in the Pennine Hills (Moor House) are compared with those in a population in lowland, southern England (Upper Seeds, Wytham Woods). The upland populations have been studied for 9 years and the lowland one for 6. (2) The Upper Seeds population was more stable (coefficient of variation 47.5) than the Moor House ones (coefficient of variation 91.5). (3) The techniques of Morris (1963) and Varley & Gradwell (1960) were used to detect regulatory processes in the populations. (4) The nymphal mortality at Moor House was not detectably density-dependent. In the Upper Seeds population it was inversely density-dependent. (5) The adult mortality at Moor House was not detectably density-dependent. At Upper Seeds it was directly density-dependent. Verrallia aucta, a dipteran parasitoid, increased this density-dependence. (6) At Moor House, the generation mortality was not detectably density-dependent. At Upper Seeds, the directly density-dependent mortality of the adults more than compensated for the inverse density-dependent mortality of the nymphs so that the generation mortality was density-dependent. (7) Major changes from one generation to the next were caused by the weather conditions at the end of the season. At Moor House, these could prevent the complete laying of one batch of eggs; at Upper Seeds they determined whether one, two or three batches were laid. (8) The two Moor House populations showed parallel changes in every year from 1961 to 1967. In 1967 the density of one of them was experimentally reduced. In the subsequent 2 years the two populations have remained significantly different in density. The low density population has not yet adjusted to the effects of being disturbed. (9) The fringe population at Moor House was poorly regulated. Local extinctions of N. lineatus occur here. The population of N. lineatus at Upper Seeds is well within the range of the species and appears to be well regulated.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Intensification of framing practices after the Second World War has led to wide scale loss of semi-natural grasslands throughout the UK. Flood-plain meadows (NVC MG4 Alopecurus pratensis-Sanguisorba officinalis grassland) suffered under these changes in agricultural management, and now cover an area of <1500 ha in England and Wales. In 1985, an experiment was initiated at Somerford Mead, Oxford, with the target of re-creating MG4 grassland. The grassland was established with a sown seed mixture harvested from local MG4 grassland. A replicated block experiment was set up to look at the effects of sheep, cattle and no grazing on the establishment of the target floral community. In 2002, the effects of these management regimes on beetle communities were investigated. Grazing regime was seen to be the primary determinant of abundance, species richness and species assemblage of the beetle population. Vegetation structure was also found to influence beetle diversity. The percentage cover of the legume Trifolium repens had important effects on beetle community assemblage, whilst Trifolium pratense was strongly correlated with the abundance of three common phytophagous beetles. This study provides a preliminary investigation into the responses of beetle communities to management intended for the re-creation of the plant communities of this threatened grassland habitat.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"In comparison with other carnivores, European badgers, Meles meles L., show an unusually high degree of natal philopatry. In this paper, we present data on temporary and permanent movements between groups, in both male and female badgers, in a moderately high density population. A relatively small proportion of males dispersed, alone, to neighbouring territories. Dispersing males were larger than those remaining in their natal groups, and following dispersal they had higher testosterone titres and maintained testicular activity for a greater part of the year. Circumstantial evidence suggests that immigrants were the principal breeding males in their new territories. Dispersal was slightly more common in females, which dispersed away from large groups, where their chances of breeding were relatively low. Females dispersed in coalitions of 2-3, over longer distances, to territories occupied by single females. Resident females disappeared following the arrival of the immigrants, suggesting that territory `takeovers' may have occurred. Members of both sexes also made temporary `visits' to neighbouring territories, probably to obtain extra‚Äêgroup matings. Comparison with other badger populations suggests that the frequency of male dispersal declines at high population densities. In contrast, there is no effect of density on female dispersal, which occurs only rarely in some other populations. We suggest that the pattern of female/female competition is too complex to be explained solely in terms of variation in population density.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"A desk-based information search recommended to inform a PEA was restricted to a search for nearby statutory designated wildlife sites and Ancient Woodland using the online Magic Map application and a search for non-statutory wildlife sites using the ‘Living List’ of Local Wildlife Sites available on the Thames Valley Environmental Records Centre (TVERC) website . An Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey was undertaken for the Site on 4 April 2017. The methodology adopted followed the standard JNCC approach to Phase 1 Habitat Survey by which all habitats present within the site were classified and mapped according to standard categories. Target notes were used to describe areas of both typical and unique botanical character. Habitat patches were mapped as polygon features, and if sufficient space on the map linear features (such as walls and fences) as lines where this provided added value. Point features were recorded where there were notable isolated trees or scrub. Plant species abundance was noted using the DAFOR4 system.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The ground flora (vascular plants less the 2 m high, excluding trees and shrubs) was recorded in 1974 and 1991 from 163 permanent 10 x 10 m plots arranged on a systematic grid across Wytham Woods, near Oxford (UK). The Woods cover about 320 ha, are predominantly deciduous, but of varying ages and management types. The total number of species found (173, 167 respectively), the mean richness per plot (16.7, 17.2) and the breakdown of the species list between different species types (ancient woodland indicators, other woodland species, non-woodland species) showed no significant differences between 1974 and 1991, but mean ground cover declined from 80% to 64%. Eight species were common across the whole wood in both years and showed little difference in frequency between areas of different histories and management (Dryopteris filix-mas. Galium aparine, Geum urbanum, Rubus fruticosus, Glechoma hederacea, Hyacinthoides non-scripta, Mercurialis perennis, Urtica dioica), Ancient woodland indicators as a group were more common in ancient stands, but some ancient woodland indicators had spread widely in the recent woodland.  Some species increased in frequency across all types of woodland including Arum maculatum, Brachypodium sylvaticum. Deschampsia cespitosa and Poa trivialis; while others such as Ajuga reptans, Angelica sylvestris and Circaea lutetiana declined. Mean cover of Rubus fruticosus per plot declined from 35% to 6% and of Mercurialis perennis from 32 to 24%. Changes in the vegetation were greater in the plantations which showed more species losses than semi-natural stands.. Significant differences were found between groups of species in terms of their Ellenberg indicator scores particularly for light, nitrogen and moisture, and in their strategy types (sensu Grime 1979). Ancient woodland indicators had the lowest light scores (most shade-tolerant) and tended to have more of a bias towards stress- tolerance in strategy terms. The indicator scores and strategy types were used to interpret the changes observed in the vegetation.  The main causes of change were the changing conditions associated with stand growth, particular increased shade in the plantations, and an increase in browsing/grazing by deer. No evidence could be found for an effect of changing soil nitrogen or pH on the vegetation despite known changes in the soil values for these parameters. Changes in the ground flora as well as the woody layers, and in managed as well as unmanaged stands should be monitored, if conservation objectives are to be met.; ",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Data from 163 permanent 10 x 10m plots established in Wytham Woods were used to look for changes in abundance between 1974 and 1991 of six ground flora species: Chamerion angustifolium, Hyacinthoides non-scriptus, Mercurialis perennis, Pteridium aquilinum, Rubus fruticosus and Urtica dioica. Chamerion angustifolium had declined in both occurrence and mean cover across the whole wood. Throughout most of this period the wood has been relatively undisturbed so sites for this species of disturbed ground have become less. Rubus fruticosus showed a major decline in cover, with little change in frequency, believed to be caused by increased deer browsing. Mercurialis perennis remained frequent but there was a decrease in the number of plots where it formed dense carpets. This may also be a grazing effect. Pteridium aquilinum declined mainly in plots where the canopy cover had increased, an effect of increased shade. Urtica dioica and Hyacinthoides showed no significant changes in cover.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"easonal changes in the numbers of individuals in two groups of dung-inhabiting beetles, Aphodius (Scarabaeidae) and Hydrophilidae, are shown to vary substantially between similar pastures situated ca. 1.5 km apart. This is suggested to be related to seasonally constant quantity and quality of their habitat and resources (droppings); in the absence of this constraint, other factors, like chance, history, and interspecific interactions, may become decisive determinants of the spatio-temporal structure of populations. The seasonal mean overlap (percentage similarity) with the most similar species in the same field, and the mean intraspecific between-field overlap, were both ca. 50%, which shows the importance of examining spatial variation in studies of niche relations. Some species of Aphodius showed bimodal seasonal distribution in numbers, which is interpreted to reflect intraspecific variation in the stage of hibernation. The relation between spatial variance in numbers and in the timing of the seasonal occurrence is discussed. It is concluded that, due to spatial variation in the species composition, intraspecific diversity in the seasonal occurrence of different species may promote rather than displace interspecific diversity.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"This report summarises ground vegetation results from five recordings (1974,1991, 1999, 2012 and 2018) of 164 permanent 10x10 m plots in Wytham Woods.  Overall mean ground flora cover per plot across the whole of the Woods went down from about 80% in 1974 to 64% in 1991, before increasing to 78% in 2018. Both substantial increases and decreases occurred at the plot level over the 45-year period, but with no overall pattern to these changes across the Woods. Canopy cover is the major limiting factor on ground vegetation cover; but tree species effects are important, with light-canopied species such as ash Fraxinus excelsior allowing more ground vegetation cover to develop.   A total of 235 species were found across all recordings, which is not outstandingly rich for the size of the Woods (c.400 ha) but includes a good representation of woodland species typical of lowland woods.  The flora is dominated by a small number of species notably Rubus fruticosus, Poa trivialis, Mercurialis perennis and Brachypodium sylvaticum; the top twelve species contributed 47% of species records across all five recordings.   The vegetation can be broadly grouped into that of the older woodland of semi-natural origin, the younger plantation stands and the more open rides and glades. The species recorded were grouped into woodland specialists (40 species, that tend to be stress tolerators, often high-shade species); the more competitive, woodland generalists (105 species) that tend to be the commonest plants in the woods; and 90 non-woodland species associated with the more open plots which have a greater ruderal element and more species with high light requirements. The contribution of non-woodland species is greatest in the Ride and Glade plots; the contribution of woodland specialists increases the longer an area has been wooded while that of non-woodland species declines.    Species richness per plot showed little variation over the 45 yrs, except for a low value in 2018 (16.7 species per plot in 1974, 17.3 in 1991, 15.5 in 1999, 16.1 in 2012, 13.5 in 2018).  There was similar pattern to the number of species recorded in total across the full set of plots (182 in 1974, 171 in 1991, 147 in 1999, 158 in 2012, 141 in 2018).  Plot species richness was negatively correlated with canopy cover over the whole period, but small differences in canopy cover (<25%) had relatively little effect on plot richness. Across all recordings, species richness in the more open Ride and Glade areas (mean 24-30 species per plot) was about 1.5-2.0 times the number found in the more closed woodland plots.  Species richness at the plot level often showed large fluctuations from one recording to the next, with both increases and decreases being common for a plot. In any one plot, only a few species were recorded across all five recordings, with many species turning up only once or twice.  The similarity (Sorensen’s Index) between recordings from the same plot steadily declined with increasing time interval between recordings. The similarity between plots from the same recording time (homogeneity) was highest in the 1990s, but then declined again. Homogeneity went both up and down in different parts of the Woods between each recording.  A major reason for increasing homogeneity was that the 20th century plantation plots became more similar to the older woodland and less like the Ride and Glade plots.   Trends seen across the Woods in the older stands of semi-natural origin appear to be partly an effect of increased canopy cover – i.e. they were becoming more shady. Ellenberg Indicator Values for light (EIV-L) per plot were negatively correlated with canopy cover and there was a general decline in Ellenberg Light Score per plot over the 45-yr period. The Competitor element of the flora declined while the Stress-tolerator element went up. Soil acidification may have contributed to some floral changes between 1974 and 1991; there were small decreases in Ellenberg Indicator Reaction (pH) scores. No thermophilisation of the ground flora was detected in terms of shifts in the mean January or mean July temperatures of the species or plot scores; there was a slight trend towards species associated with higher annual rainfall, but this may be an artefact through the favouring of more shady floras. There was no overall change in Ellenberg Indicator Values for Nitrogen. There was an increase for the 20th Century plantation group of plots, but other plots often showed decreases. Some high EIV-N species such as Alliaria petiolata are however increasing. There was also a weak negative relationship between an increase in EIV-N and a decline in species richness (but R2 less than 10%)   Most species were present in plots with only low cover-abundance, whether measured by frequency in 13 sub-quadrats (0.1 m2 each) recorded across the main plot or by overall cover estimated by eye. A small number of species dominate the high frequency/high cover values which tend also to be the species with high overall plot occurrences such as Rubus fruticosus or Mercurialis perennis. Changes in within plot cover-abundance tend to be similar to changes in overall frequency of occurrence (no of plots in which a species was present), e.g. declining Chamerion angustifolium, increasing Brachypodium sylvaticum and Hedera helix. For a few species the trends were different: bramble Rubus fruticosus showed large within-plot declines in cover between 1974 and 1999 but little overall change in number of plots in which it occurred. The biggest single change in the vegetation over the 45 years was the decline in cover of bramble and rise in Brachypodium sylvaticum between 1974 and 1999, and the reversal of this trend between 1999-2018. There was a general trend for species that had been increasing up to 1999 to then decrease in the period from 1999-2018. Biomass per plot, estimated using the Phytocalc approach, halved between 1974 and 1991 but has shown a slight upward trend since. The decline (and recovery) in biomass was driven largely by the change in the cover of bramble. The major driver of change apart from light appears to be the major increase in deer pressure between 1974 and 1999; subsequent deer management has allowed a partial recovery. Changes in the ground flora at Wytham Woods tend to be site-specific although they show some similarities to changes seen across wider parts of the country. Further changes in the ground flora are expected as the canopy cover changes in response to Ash Dieback.   ",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Oxford Botanic Garden is the oldest surviving botanic garden in Britain and has occupied its site in central Oxford since 1621. Conceived as a place to grow medicinal plants, born in the turmoil of civil war and nurtured during the restoration of the monarchy, the garden has, unsurprisingly, a curious past. By tracing the work and priorities of each of the garden's keepers, this book explores its importance as one of the world's oldest scientific plant collections. It tells the story of the planting of the garden by its first keeper, Jacob Bobart, and his son, together with how they changed the garden to suit their own needs. The story develops during the eighteenth century as the garden grew exotic plants under glass and acquired a fine succulent collection but then experienced a downturn under the stewardship of the eccentric Professor Humphrey Sibthorp (famous for giving just one lecture in thirty-seven years). Finally, the narrative throws light on the partnership of gardener William Baxter and academic Charles Daubeny in the early nineteenth century, which gave the garden its glasshouses and ponds and contributed to its survival to the present day. This generously illustrated book is the first history of the garden and arboretum for more than a century and provides an essential introduction to one of Oxford's much-loved haunts.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Lists of pre-Linnaean polynomial names of the plants growing in seventeenth-century European living plant collections are commonplace. However, comparison among lists and interpretation of polynomials in terms of modern Linnaean binomials is a major challenge for researchers. This paper shows the importance of extant pre-Linnaean collections of herbarium specimens for interpreting lists of plant names. More than 4,000 polynomials reported from the Oxford Physic Garden between 1648 and 1676 are linked to over 1,300 Linnaean species names based on an objective methodology. These fundamental data show that medicinal, culinary and ornamental plants attracted attention in the seventeenth-century garden but that most species were primarily of botanical interest. Nearly 60 per cent of the species were introductions to Britain. Linnaean binomials reveal how the number and sorts of species changed between 1648 and 1676 and how the garden was used.",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"The Wytham Tit Project is a long-term population study of two woodland bird species - great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus)  - based at Wytham Woods near Oxford, UK, and is run by the Edward Grey Institute in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford. Although the majority of the work focusses on great and blue tits, there are smaller populations of coal tits (Periparus ater) and marsh tits (Poecile palustris) which are of particular interest for their role in interspecific flocking and information spread. As with much of the UK, the willow tit (Poecile montana) no longer breeds in Wytham. ",

     "Abstract/Study Aims":"Floral foraging resources are valuable for pollinator conservation on farmland, and their provision is encouraged by agri-environment schemes in many countries. Across Europe, wildflower seed mixtures are widely sown on farmland to encourage pollinators, but the extent to which key pollinator groups such as solitary bees exploit and benefit from these resources is unclear. We used high-throughput sequencing of 164 pollen samples extracted from the brood cells of six common cavity-nesting solitary bee species (Osmia bicornis, Osmia caerulescens, Megachile versicolor, Megachile ligniseca, Megachile centuncularis and Hylaeus confusus) which are widely distributed across the UK and Europe. We documented their pollen use across 19 farms in southern England, UK, revealing their forage plants and examining the structure of their pollen transport networks. Of the 32 plant species included currently in sown wildflower mixes, 15 were recorded as present within close foraging range of the bees on the study farms, but only Ranunculus acris L. was identified within the pollen samples. Rosa canina L. was the most commonly found of the 23 plant species identified in the pollen samples, suggesting that, in addition to providing a nesting resource for Megachile leafcutter bees, it may be an important forage plant for these species. Higher levels of connectance and nestedness were characteristic of pollen transport networks on farms with abundant floral resources, which may increase resilience to species loss. Our data suggest that plant species promoted currently by agri-environment schemes are not optimal for solitary bee foraging. If a diverse community of pollinators is to be supported on UK and European farmland, additional species such as R. canina should be encouraged to meet the foraging requirements of solitary bees.",
