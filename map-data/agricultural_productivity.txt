Hoffland	2014	Plant species richness promotes soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in grasslands without legumes	"Summary: The storage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil is important ecosystem functions. Grassland biodiversity experiments have shown a positive effect of plant diversity on soil C and N storage. However, these experiments all included legumes, which constitute an important N input through N2-fixation. Indeed, the results of these experiments suggest that N2 fixation by legumes is a major driver of soil C and N storage. We studied whether plant diversity affects soil C and N storage in the absence of legumes. In an 11-year grassland biodiversity experiment without legumes, we measured soil C and N stocks. We further determined above-ground biomass productivity, standing root biomass, soil organic matter decomposition and N mineralization rates to understand the mechanisms underlying the change in soil C and N stocks in relation to plant diversity and their feedbacks to plant productivity. We found that soil C and N stocks increased by 18% and 16% in eight-species mixtures compared to the average of monocultures of the same species, respectively. Increased soil C and N stocks were mainly driven by increased C input and N retention, resulting from enhanced plant productivity, which surpassed enhanced C loss from decomposition. Importantly, higher soil C and N stocks were associated with enhanced soil N mineralization rates, which can explain the strengthening of the positive diversity-productivity relationship observed in the last years of the experiment. Synthesis. We demonstrated that also in the absence of legumes, plant species richness promotes soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks via increased plant productivity. In turn, enhanced soil C and N stocks showed a positive feedback to plant productivity via enhanced N mineralization, which could further accelerate soil C and N storage in the long term. © 2014 British Ecological Society."

Mogensen	2015	Carbon footprint of cheese produced on milk from Holstein and Jersey cows fed hay differing in herb content	"The objective of the study was to assess the impact on emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) of cheese production based on milk from different types of hay and breeds of cows in Denmark. An integral part of the study involved estimating GHG emissions from production of hay in a climate less favourable for field drying. The GHG emission was estimated using life cycle assessment (LCA) with kg of milk and kg of energy-corrected milk (ECM) delivered to the dairy and kg of cheese at the retailer as functional units (FU). Allocation at farm gate, between milk and meat, was made according to the biological relation between energy requirement for milk and meat production or as an economic allocation. Allocation at the dairy, between cheese and whey, was made either as an economic allocation or by system expansion. Inventory data were based on farm, herd and crop production data from commercial farms participating in research activities with controlled production of hay, in combination with either production information from cheese processing or literature estimates, all built into a static model. There was no effect on GHG emission per kg cheese of the proportion of herbs in the hay, but an effect of breed was found. The carbon footprint (CF) per kg cheese was lowest - 9.88 kg CO2 eq. - for milk from the Jersey herd compared with 12.1 and 12.7 from the two Holstein herds, although the GHG emission per kg milk at farm gate was highest from Jersey, but this was more than offset by a higher utilisation of Jersey milk for cheese production. The GHG emission from farm to retailer contributed less than 10% to total emissions, with the largest contribution from the energy used for cheese manufacture at the dairy, including storage. Methane was the largest source at approximately 50%, followed by feed production and the rearing of heifers. Use of energy for hay-drying added 7-8% to emissions and soil carbon change on average 3%, with some variation between farms. The sensitivity analysis showed that higher herb content could potentially reduce methane emissions by 6-7%, while the herbs' larger roots had only a marginal effect on GHG emissions from soil carbon at product level. If the feed conversion in Holstein breeds was assumed the same as in Jersey, the difference in emission per kg cheese due to breed was reduced but still lower from Jersey, which illustrates the positive effect of Jersey milk composition on cheese production efficiency.

Eekeren	2020	Can the presence of plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) improve nitrogen cycling of dairy grassland systems on peat soils? (Special Issue: Role of plants in reducing nitrogen losses.)	"Reactive nitrogen (N) losses, and in particular nitrous oxide losses, from dairy grasslands on peat soils are generally high as a result of relative high soil organic matter contents, potential N mineralisation rates and shallow groundwater levels. Effects of the inclusion of the temperate forage species plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) (PL), which produces secondary compounds with biological nitrification inhibition capacity, on the fate of soil mineral N were studied in a combined mesocosm and field experiment. The experiments comprised four treatments differing in intentional herbage share of plantain versus perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (100%PL, 66%PL, 33%PL and 0%PL). Potential nitrification in the mesocosm experiment was significantly lower at 100%PL versus 0%PL (p=0.018), but soil nitrate concentrations were not. Nitrous oxide fluxes reduced by 39% (p=0.021) in the presence of plantain in the field experiment, without an obvious link to the quantity of plantain. N use efficiency of plantain tended to increase with the quantity of plantain in the sward in the mesocosm experiment (p=0.098), but not in the field experiment. Our results suggest that the presence of plantain can affect the fate of soil mineral N of dairy grasslands on peat soils."

Data was collected from a site in Berkshire (UK), where a field-scale, randomised block experiment had been implemented to investigate how the establishment of a variety of plant functional groups (grasses, legumes, and other flowering forbs) using different cultivation (minimum tillage and deep ploughing) and management (cutting, grazing and their intensity) techniques, affected the provision of various ecosystem services. All surveyors and laboratory workers were trained and followed standardised protocols in all cases. Specific forms were used for recording data in the field and in the lab. The data were checked for anomalous entries. Details of the methodologies have been published (see other useful information regarding this dataset).

Bezemer	2020	Above-belowground linkages of functionally dissimilar plant communities and soil properties in a grassland experiment	"Changes in plant community composition can have long-lasting consequences for ecosystem functioning. However, how the duration of plant growth of functionally distinct grassland plant communities influences abiotic and biotic soil properties and thus ecosystem functions is poorly known. In a field experiment, we established identical experimental subplots in two successive years comprising of fast- or slow-growing grass and forb community mixtures with different forb:grass ratios. After one and two years of plant growth, we measured above- and belowground biomass, soil abiotic characteristics (pH, organic matter, soil nutrients), soil microbial properties (respiration, biomass, community composition), and nematode abundance. Fast- and slow-growing plant communities did not differ in above- and belowground biomass. However, fast-and slow-growing plant communities created distinct soil bacterial communities, whereas soil fungal communities differed most in 100% forb communities compared to other forb:grass ratio mixtures. Moreover, soil nitrate availability was higher after two years of plant growth, whereas the opposite was true for soil ammonium concentrations. Furthermore, total nematodes and especially bacterial-feeding nematodes were more abundant after two years of plant growth. Our results show that plant community composition is a driving factor in soil microbial community assembly and that the duration of plant growth plays a crucial role in the establishment of plant community and functional group composition effects on abiotic and biotic soil ecosystem functioning under natural field conditions. The experimental site was established in spring 2015 in a restored grassland site (abandoned from agricultural use in 1996), De Mossel (Natuurmonumenten, Ede, The Netherlands, 52° 04 N, 5° 45 E). The area around De Mossel is characterized by a mean daily temperature of 16.7 °C in summer months and 1.7 °C in winter months and monthly precipitation ranges from 48 to 76 mm (based on open source data from long-term climate models; www.climate-data.org). The soil of the field site is described as a holtpodzol and soil texture is characterized as sandy loam (94% sand, 4% silt, 2% clay, ~5% organic matter, 5.2 pH, 2.5 mg kg-1 N, 4.0 mg kg-1 P, 16.5 mg kg-1 K) (Jeffery et al. 2017). In total, 100 experimental plots (1.66 x 2.50 m) were installed and each plot was divided into two subplots (each 0.83 2.50 m) resulting in 200 subplots (De Long et al. 2019). Experimental plots were randomly arranged in four blocks. To study the effects of the duration of plant growth of distinct plant communities, the top-soil (about 4 cm depth) including the previously existing plant communities of 100 subplots was removed in May 2015 (later referred to as two-year subplots) whereupon experimental plant communities were sown immediately. In May 2016 (later referred to as one-year subplots) the top-soil including the previously existing plant communities was removed of the remaining 100 subplots and experimental plant communities were then sown. In total, 24 predominantly perennial plant communities based on their economic spectrum (fast- versus slow-growing species) and differences in forb:grass ratio were chosen. Fast- or slow-growing grasses or forbs were selected from a pool of 24 grassland species that all co-occur locally at this site. Plants were assigned to fast- versus slow-growing species based on known growth rates (Fitter and Peat 1994, Fry et al. 2014) or after consultation with botanists (Jasper van Ruijven, Henrik Poorter, personal communication). Three fast- (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3) and three slow- (Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) growing plant communities were used in the experiment, each mixture consisted of 3 or 6 plant species (three grasses and/or three forbs) (Table 1). Specifically, sown plant communities differed in forb:grass ratios as per seeding such as a) three fast- or slow-growing forb species (100%); b) three fast- or slow-growing grass species (100%); or c) three fast- or slow-growing forbs and three fast- or slow-growing grasses (25% grass and 75% forb or 75% forb and 25% grass). Sowing density amounted to 12,000 seeds per subplot, representing each plant species in equal amounts of seeds. Seeds were obtained from specialized suppliers that provide seeds collected from wild plants (Cruydt Hoeck, Nijeberkoop, The Netherlands and MediGran, Hoorn, The Netherlands) in 2015. Additionally, after top-soil removal, in each block two experimental subplots were kept bare one from May 2015 onwards, and one from May 2016. These plots served as a control to permit the comparison of ecosystem processes in the absence of vegetation. In 2015 and 2016, during the growth season (May through September) all sown subplots and bare control subplots were regularly weeded to maintain the sown plant community composition. In total, this resulted in 2 temporal treatments (two- and one-year; represented by the level of subplots) and 25 plant community treatment combinations (2 community growth rates (fast, slow) 4 forb:grass ratios (0:100; 25:75; 75:25 or 100:0 % forb:grass; represented by the level of plots) 3 species combinations + 1 bare control), which were replicated across four blocks (200 subplots). The efficiency of the establishment of experimental plant communities was reported previously in De Long et al. (2019). Here, it was shown that the six different plant communities (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3, Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) significantly differed in their composition whereas fast-growing plant communities and slow-growing plant communities were clustering separately. Furthermore, it was reported that the actual percentage cover of both forbs and grasses corresponded well to the treatments. Data collection Above- and belowground biomass - In the beginning of June 2017, aboveground biomass production was assessed within two randomly selected squares (25 x 25 cm; minimum 10 cm distant to the edge) in each subplot by cutting plants just above the soil level. Aboveground biomass of all samples was determined by weighing after drying at 70°C for 72 h and later converted to g per m. After the aboveground biomass was clipped in a subplot, one soil core (diameter 3 cm, 10 cm deep) was taken from the center of the square. The fresh soil weight was determined, and the roots were then washed over a 0.425 mm sieve. Root biomass was then determined after drying at 40 °C for 72 h and later converted to gram per gram fresh weight of soil. Soil sampling - Soil sampling was carried out in two sampling campaigns. First, soil samples were collected in March 2017. Here, 20 soil samples (metal corer: diameter 1 cm, 10 cm deep) were taken randomly per subplot, pooled and homogenized. Approximately 2 g of fresh soil was immediately frozen at -80 °C for DNA-based determination of the soil microbial community composition. In mid May 2017, an additional 20 soil samples (metal corer: diameter 3 cm, 10 cm deep) were taken randomly per subplot. The soil samples were pooled, homogenized and divided into several subsamples. About 50 g of fresh soil for nematode extraction was kept in a fridge (4 °C). Approximately 20 g was sieved (2 mm mesh size) to remove stones, roots, and invertebrates >2 mm, and then stored at -20 °C for measurements of soil microbial properties (soil microbial respiration and biomass), the remaining soil was dried at 40 °C and used to measure soil abiotic characteristics. Soil abiotic characteristics - The soil was dried at 40 °C until the soil weight was stable and sieved (mesh size: 1.4 mm) to remove roots and stones. Three grams of dried soil were mixed with 30 ml of 0.01 M CaCl2 and shaken for 2 h on a mechanical shaker with linear movement at 250 rpm. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. Then, 15 mL of the supernatant was filtered through a Whatman Puradisc Aqua 30 syringe filter with a cellulose acetate membrane and 130 muL HNO3 was added to 12.87 mL of the filtrate. Soil extractable elements (Fe, K, Mg, P, S, Zn) were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES,Thermo ScientificiCAP6500DuoInstrument with axial and radial view and CID detector microwave digestion system). The remaining filtrate (2.13 mL) was used to measure soil pH and to measure nitrite (NO2-N) + nitrate (NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-N) on a QuAAtro Autoanalyzer (Seal analytical). Soil organic matter - Soil organic matter content was estimated by the loss‐on‐ignition (LOI) method (Heiri et al. 2001). Approximately 5 g of soil was oven dried at 105 °C for 16 h and weighed. The sample was then burned at 550 °C for 5 h and weighed again. Soil organic matter was calculated as the percentage weight loss between the oven-dried and burned samples. Soil microbial respiration and biomass - Approximately 5 g soil (fresh weight) was weighed into 50 mL centrifuge tubes to determine soil microbial respiration and soil microbial biomass. The lid of each tube was sealed gas-tight using an O-ring and a rubber septum in the middle. For basal respiration measurements, the tubes were capped and flushed with CO2-free air to remove any CO2 from the headspace. After 24 h hours of incubation at 20 °C, 12 ml of headspace was sampled using a gas-tight syringe. Microbial biomass was determined after addition of D-glucose-monohydrate using the substrate-induced respiration method (SIR) (Anderson and Domsch, 1978). Next, 2 ml of 75 mM D-glucose solution were added to each soil sample and placed on a horizontal shaker for 1 h. Tubes were capped, flushed with CO2-free air and incubated for 4 h at 20 °C. Again, 12 ml of headspace was sampled. Measurements of the CO2 concentrations were carried out on a Trace CG Ultra gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy). Gravimetric soil water content was determined by drying the soil samples overnight at 60 °C to constant weight and calculating the difference in weight between fresh and dried soil. Soil microbial community composition - DNA was extracted from 0.75 g of soil using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturers protocol. The DNA quantity was measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA). Approximately 100 ng of DNA was used for a PCR. We used the primers ITS4ngs and ITS3mix targeting the ITS2 region of fungal genes (Tedersoo et al. 2015) and the primers 515FB and 806RB (Caporaso et al. 2012, Apprill et al. 2015, Parada et al. 2016) targeting the V4 region of the 16Sr RNA gene in bacteria. Presence of PCR product was checked using agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Adapters and barcodes were added to samples using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit set A (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The final PCR product was purified again with AMPure beads, checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer before equimolar pooling. We pooled all fungal samples (200) in one Miseq PE250 run and divided the bacterial samples in two separate runs (100 samples each; 1st run: block 1 and 2, 2nd run: block 3 and 4). Libraries were sequenced at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center, Canada. Extraction negatives were also sequenced. A mock community, containing 10 fungal species, was included to investigate the accuracy of the bioinformatics analysis. Bacterial sequences and fungal sequences were analyzed using the PIPITS pipeline and the Hydra pipeline, respectively (Gweon et al. 2015, Hollander 2017). In short, fungal sequences were paired using VSEARCH and quality was filtered using standard parameters. The ITS2 region was extracted using ITSx (Bengtsson-Palme et al. 2013). Short reads were removed, and sequences were clustered based on a 97% similarity threshold using VSEARCH and chimeric sequences were removed by comparing with UNITE uchime database. The representative sequences were identified using the RDP classifier against the UNITE database (Koljalg et al. 2005). For bacterial sequences VSEARCH was used to pair sequences and cluster them or classification, SINA classification was used with the SILVA database. Nematode extraction - Decantation (Cobb 1918) and centrifugal flotation methods (Van Bezooijen 2006) were used to extract nematodes from 50 g fresh soil collected from block 1 and 2 (100 subplots). Briefly, soil samples were weighed, suspended in 3 L water and stirred until a homogenous suspension was obtained. The suspension was settled for 15 sec and the supernatant decanted into a plastic bowl. This procedure was repeated three times and the obtained suspension was passed through one 75 m and three 45 m sieves and collected into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. The nematode suspension was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm and the supernatant was carefully poured off. Sugar solution (484 g/L) was added, fully mixed with the remaining sediment in the tube and centrifuged again for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was poured over a 30 m sieve. Nematodes on the sieve were carefully rinsed with water and collected in a beaker for microscopic analysis). All nematodes were counted and classified by microscopy to one of five feeding types (root feeders, fungivores, omnivores, bacterivores, or predators) according to Yeates et al. (1993). However, predatory nematodes were excluded from further analysis because of low abundance. Data analysis We used linear mixed-effects models to test the effects of duration of plant growth (one- and two-year subplots), community growth rates (fast vs. slow), and forb:grass ratios on above- and root biomass, soil abiotic characteristics (pH, Fe, K, Mg, P, S, Zn, NO2-N +NO3-N, NH4-N), soil organic matter, soil microbial properties, and feeding types of nematodes. Thereby, plot and plant community identity (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3, Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) were included as random factors. Above- and belowground biomass, chemical abiotic characteristics and soil microbial properties (respiration and biomass) data were ln- transformed to meet assumptions of ANOVA. Linear mixed- effects models were performed using lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015), whereas p-values and degrees of freedom were estimated with Type III Kenward-Roger approximation using lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al. 2017). We further used comparisons of means for treatment- specific effects (Tukeys HSD test; alpha < 0.05). Tukeys tests were performed using and multcomp package (Hothorn et al. 2016). Bare plots were excluded from analysis, but their values are displayed in graphs. To test the effects of duration of plant growth, community growth rates, and forb:grass ratios on bacterial and fungal community compositions, we first filtered out taxa that were present in less than ten samples and had an abundance of less than 0.01%. ITS sequences derived from other organisms than fungi were further removed and for 16S rRNA data mitochondria and chloroplast sequences were removed. For both bacteria and fungi, samples with less than 1000 reads of more than 80 000 reads remaining were removed from the dataset and read numbers were further normalized using total sum scaling (TSS). Mock communities consisting of 10 fungal species were used to inspect the filtering done for fungi. After filtering, we detected 13 fungal OTUs which shows that we might be slightly overestimating the diversity. Afterwards, we ran permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) (based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, 999 permutations) on both bacterial and fungal OTUs using the adonis function in the vegan package (Oksanen et al. 2016). However, here we only used one- and two-year subplots to test for the differences in plant community effect on soil microbial community composition. Since the basic assumption of PERMANOVA analysis is a balanced design and homogenization of samples, bare subplots were excluded due to lower number of samples than the one-and two-year subplots. For visualization we applied a nonmetric multidimensional (NMDS) analysis of the dissimilarities (based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities) in microbial community composition using ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016). All statistics were performed within the R statistical environment (Version 3.5.1; R Core Team, 2018).

Edwards	2013	Productivity of rotationally grazed simple and diverse pasture mixtures under irrigation in Canterbury 	"Herbage dry matter (DM) production, botanical composition and nutritive value were compared over 2 years under irrigation and dairy cow grazing for simple two-species grass (perennial ryegrass or tall fescue)- white clover pastures and diverse pastures where herbs (chicory and plantain), legumes (red clover and lucerne) and prairie grass were added to the simple mixtures. Averaged over 2 years, annual herbage DM production was 1.62 t DM/ha greater in diverse (16.77 t DM/ ha) than simple (15.15 t DM/ha) pastures, primarily reflecting greater DM production in summer. Diverse pastures had lower metabolisable energy (ME) (12.0 vs 12.2 MJ ME/kg DM) and neutral detergent fibre (301 vs 368 g/kg DM) content than simple pastures, although the total ME produced per year was greater in diverse than simple pastures (202 vs 185 GJ ME/ha). Ryegrass- based pastures had higher annual DM production than tall fescue-based pastures in the first but not second year. The results indicate that including additional legumes and herbs with simple grass-white clover pastures may increase total DM and ME production of dairy pastures under irrigation.

Systems based on perennial ryegrass pastures are often limited by poor growth and feed quality when soil moisture is low and temperatures are high. Alternative forage species better adapted to these conditions may provide options for maintaining feed supply. Annual and seasonal dry matter (DM) production, and nutritive value of five grazable forages with and without irrigation were compared under cutting in the Waikato over two successive years. Perennial ryegrass produced the greatest annual DM yield in both years under both irrigation regimes, largely through superior cool season production and mild temperatures with above average rainfall during the experiment. Plantain tended to provide more DM than perennial ryegrass under irrigation in summer and autumn, a time when additional DM is important for maintaining milk production. With the exception of sudan grass, nutritive value of all forages exceeded values expected to limit milk production "	Proceedings of the New Zealand Grassland Association 	75	245-250	New Zealand	"Scott Farm (DairyNZ), Hamilton"	-37.778	175.351	Herbal leys	Herbage dry matter (HDM)	Table 2	2008	2010	2		Randomised block	6	High	"Averaged yield across all years and irrigation treatments, in separate excel spreadsheet"

The herbal ley seeds mixture was prepared following the pioneering ideas of Robert Elliot in his “Clifton Park”mixture, which basically included a group of ‘non-aggressive’ grasses, forage legumes and herbs. Pasture production (average of 2 years) from Herbal ley was 15 t DM/ha/yr, representing approximately 90% of the yield from the intensively managed pure ryegrass pasture receiving 400 kg N/ ha&r and some 2530% more than from ryegrass- clover. A major feature of the herbal ley was substantialproductionduringlate.springandsummer, when chicory (the most dominant herb), and red clover and white clover made a major contribution to herbage yield. In winter the total yield was similar tothatI?omthegrass-cloverpasture.Legumecontent was 23 and 3 1% (averaged over the year) for Grass- clover and Herbal ley pastures respectively. In spite of this difference, symbiotic N fixation was similar. So fixation efficiency on a legume yield basis was 50.3 and 3 1.6 kg N fixed/t legume DM harvested, respectively. These results could reflect a different pattern of utilisation of soil N, as a consequence of the different botanical composition of the swards. In summary, the performance of the herbal ley offers the promise of an alternative, ‘specialist’ pasture and would be highly beneficial if quality feed is required in summer."

A pasture containing only ryegrass and white clover (RG), or high- sugar ryegrass and white clover (HS), was compared with a diverse pasture mix (HSD) including chicory, plantain, lotus, high-sugar ryegrass, and white clover. The experiment was conducted over a 10-d period us- ing 3 groups of 12 cows in late lactation. No difference was observed in dry matter (14.3 kg of dry matter/ cow per day) or N (583 g of N/cow per day) intake between treatments. The cows grazing the HSD pasture had an increased milk yield (16.9 kg/d) compared with those grazing the simple RG and HS pastures (15.2 and 14.7 kg/d, respectively). However, no differences were observed in milk solids yield for the 3 treatments. A tendency toward greater milk protein yields in the HSD group resulted in improved N use efficiency for milk of 20.4% from the cows fed HSD, compared with 17.8 and 16.7% from cows in the RG and HS treatments, respec- tively. Urinary N excretion was lower from the cows fed HSD, at 353.8 g/d, compared with 438.3 and 426.6 g/d for cows fed RG and HS, respectively.

The time to first grazing, with sheep, was 8, 12, or 19 weeks from an autumn sowing. After 8 weeks there was > 30 % plant loss for all species compared with a loss of 3% and 13% at 19 weeks for plantain and chicory, respectively. Plantain and chicory required a minimum of six and seven true leaves, respectively, for sufficient root growth for plant survival after grazing. Modelling showed that plantain and chicory need to be sown before mid-March in Manawatu to be ready for their first grazing before winter.

Grasslands Goldie), lucerne (Medicago sativa; cv. Grasslands Oranga), and a mixture of lucerne and lotus. Measurements were made of pre- and post-grazing herbage mass, the composition of the feed on offer and diet selected, and of voluntary feed intake (VFI; Experiment 2 only), body growth, and wool growth. From the agronomic measurements, it was concluded that the diet selected was mainly leaf in both experiments. Total condensed tannin (CT) content was 32-57 g/kg DM for lotus, 8-10 g/kg DM for the mixture, and negligible for lucerne (less than 2 g/kg DM). In Experiment 1, ewe wool production and lamb liveweight gain (LWG) did not differ between forages, but ewe LWG was greater on lotus than on lucerne (251 versus 65 g/day; P<0.001), with the mixture being intermediate (115 g/day). In Experiment 2, VFI (1.76 versus 1.65 kg organic matter (OM)/day; P <0.05), LWG (228 versus 183 g/day; P < 0.001), wool production (2.78 versus 2.25 kg; P <0.05), and carcass weight (20.4 versus 17.8 kg; P < 0.05) were greater for lambs grazing lotus than lucerne; lambs grazing the mixture had similar VFI (1.63 kg OM/day) to those grazing lucerne, but wool production (2.49 kg) was intermediate between lambs grazing lucerne and lotus. Male lambs showed a greater LWG response to lotus relative to lucerne (+83 g/day P < 0.01) than female lambs (+15 g/day; P > 0.05). When adjusted for differences in carcass weight, lotus did not affect carcass fatness (GR 13.1 versus 12.8 mm; P > 0.05). It was concluded that Lotus corniculatus (cv.

The Winchmore project (Lismore stony-silt-loam~739%iiir%iifall)-included 11 species: lucerne (Grasslands Otaio), sheep’s burnet, birdsfoot trefoil (Grasslands Goldie), red clover (Grasslands Colenso), browntop (Grasslands Muster), chicory (Grasslands Puna), wheatgrass (Grasslands Luna), ryegrass (Grasslands Pacific), smooth brome (Grasslands Tiki), upland brome (Grasslands Hal&) and grazing brome (Grasslands Gala). Over the first three years Otaio has remained as one of the best producers, but Colenso and Tiki, while producing well in the first year havedropped considerably by year three. Results demonstrate that there is potential for some species tested to enhance the production on the light east coast soils in the South Island but in the long-term persistence must be monitored."

The mean annual production of lucerne (20 t DM/ha) was greater than red clover and chicory (16 t DM/ha). The advantage of lucerne increased with time to 6 t DM/ ha in the final year, when the lucerne component of the sward was 94%, whereas chicory and red clover declined to 62 and 0% of their respective swards. The annual production advantage of lucerne was a result of higher growth rates in September and from December to May. The higher summer/autumn growth rates were attributed to a greater water extraction depth, giving lucerne access to more water during this time. The DM yield of all three species had a linear relationship with water use. These results are discussed in relation to the fitness of the three species for a dryland farming system, and how the performance of each would be expected to vary with differing soil type and rainfall situations."

red clover was the most suitable for inclusion in grazing systems as specialist forage. This initial evaluation
compares the annual and seasonal dry matter (DM) production of the species. Plots were grazed with sheep and soil
water was maintained at optimal levels with irrigation. After each grazing there was a lag phase while new shoot
growth accelerated to a consistent rate termed the linear growth phase. Lucerne production was 28 t DM/ha in the
1997/98 season, which was at least 7 t DM/ha greater than red clover and chicory. Shorter growth duration in
1998/99 reduced lucerne production to 22 t DM/ha but this was still at least 7 t DM/ha more than both red clover and
chicory. The greater lucerne production was due to higher linear growth rates and a longer duration of linear growth
in early spring and autumn. There was no general relationship between air temperature and linear growth rates of
each species, probably due to the storage and remobilization of root assimilate at different times of the year. From
the total and pattern of DM production it was concluded that lucerne was the most suitable species for use as a
specialist forage crop. "	Agronomy NZ	30	129-137	New Zealand	"Lincoln University, Canterbury "	-43.639	172.457	Herbal leys	Herbage dry matter (HDM)	Table 2	1996	1999	2		Split plot randomised complete block	3	High

Dairy cows were offered ad libitum allowances of a ‘short-term winter’ sward, based on Italian ryegrass (treatment STW), a ‘long-term winter’ sward, based on a winter-active tall fescue (treatment LTW), a ‘long- term summer’ sward, based on a summer-active tall fescue (treatment LTS) and a Control sward (perennial ryegrass) in four seasons (days in milk in parentheses): spring (November dairy cows, 124), summer (February, 227), autumn (May, 234) and winter (August, sixty- four). A ‘short-term summer’ sward, based on chicory and white clover (treatment STS), was also included in summer. There was a significant season · treatment interaction caused by a more gradual decline in milk yield from peak for cows grazing treatment LTS com- pared to the Control treatment in the transition period from spring to summer. In summer, cows grazing treatment STS produced more milk (1Æ41 kg fat plus protein per cow d)1) than cows grazing all other treatments (0Æ92kg per cow d)1) because of the superior nutritive value of herbage of pre-grazing pasture and higher apparent dry-matter intakes. Swards based on alternative species to perennial ryegrass are capable of supporting milk production that is at least comparable over an annual cycle."

Forty four twin-bearing (twin) and 42 triplet-bearing (triplet) mixed-aged Romney ewes that were a maximum of 140 days pregnant (P140) were randomly allocated to one of two nutritional treatments being: a mix of chicory, plantain, white and red clover (Herb), or a ryegrass dominant sward (Ryegrass) to form the following groups: twin Ryegrass n = 22, triplet Ryegrass n=20, twin Herb n=22 and triplet Herb n=22. Ewes and their lambs remained on these herbage treatments until 66 days after the mid-point of lambing (L66). By L66, ewes grazing the Herb treatment compared to ewes on the Ryegrass treatment were heavier (P<0.05; 70.9 ± 1.17 kg versus 66.1 ± 1.15 kg) and had higher (P<0.05) body condi- tion scores (2.8 ± 0.07 versus 2.4 ± 0.07, respectively). Ewes grazing the Herb treatment produced more milk (P<0.05) at each of the three sampling periods (3137 ± 161.3 versus 2613±148.1 at day 7, 3280±148.8 versus 2483±153.1 at day 14 and 3237±131.8mL versus 2428 ± 136.2 mL at day 21). Lambs from ewes grazing the Herb treatment were heav- ier (P<0.05) at L22 (10.36 ± 0.274 kg versus 9.29 ± 0.272 kg) and L66 (20.67 ± 0.490 kg versus 17.55 ± 0.493 kg). The higher live weights (LW) were due to higher (P<0.05) LW gains of Herb lambs between birth and L22 (298 ± 10.8 g/day versus 245 ± 10.7 g/day) and between L39 and L66 (268 ± 16.2 g/day versus 179 ± 15.9 g/day). Herb triplet-bearing ewes produced more (P<0.05) total lamb LW by L66 than Ryegrass triplet-bearing ewes (45.70 ± 3.051 kg versus 28.26±3.203kg, respectively). Results demonstrate that a herb sward mix can improve multiple ewe and lamb performance compared to a ryegrass dominant sward."

Liveweight gain and trace element status of lambs grazing pure plantain (Plantago lanceolata) swards and high endophyte perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) pastures was evaluated for 85 days during summer (December - March) under irrigated conditions. Liveweight gain was significantly (P<0.01) higher for lambs grazing plantain (222 g/head /day) than ryegrass swards (135 g/head/day) when both were offered at an allowance of 2.5kg DM/head/day. Despite a lower stocking rate on plantain swards, lamb liveweight gain expressed on a per-hectare basis tended to be greater for the plantain treatment (6.0 kg/ha/day) than for the ryegrass treatment (5.1 kg /ha/day) although this did not reach statistical significance. Lambs grazing pure plantain swards had significantly (P<0.01) higher liver copper (2250 vs 715 (μmol/ kg fresh wt) and higher liver selenium (671 vs 380 (nmol/kg fresh wt) concentrations but similar vitamin B12 (620 vs 571 nmol/kg fresh wt) concentration compared with ryegrass-fed lambs. These results indicate that well managed plantain is able to support relatively high rates of liveweight gain in lambs through summer and elevate liver copper and selenium concentrations and, therefore, could make a significant contribution to pastures in lamb finishing systems."

Drenched lambs grazing luceme had the highest LWG (243g/day) and plantain the lowest LWG (51.2gIday). Undrenched lambs had lower LWG’s than the drenched lambs, ranging from 175gklay when grazing sulk, to a small loss of 2g/day while grazing plantain. Wool growth followed a broadly similarpattern. FEC’s were lowest in lambs grazing sullaand highest in lambs grazing plantain. Total worm burdens were lowest in the lambs grazing sulla and highest in lambs grazing maku. Undrenched lambs grazing maku had much lower dry dag weights than those on the other herbages, with those on ryegrass/white clover having the highest.
The high production level obtained in lambs grazing sulla and maku, despite the high worm burdens indicates that these herbages could be used within farm grazing rotations to reduce anthehnintic usage. The marked reduction in dag weights on maku may also be of economic benefit by reducing the need for crutching and the risk of flystrike."

Half the ewes grazing L. corniculatus were given twice daily oral polyethylene glycol 􏰀PEG: molecular weight 3500) supplementation to inactivate the condensed tannins 􏰀CTs) in lotus. A rotational grazing system with 225 mixed age ewes 􏰀53X2 􏰂 3X78 kg per ewe) was used, with 75 ewes per treatment.
The effect of forage species and PEG supplementation upon voluntary feed intake 􏰀VFI), concentration of plasma metabolites, reproductive ef®ciency, wool production and wool length was measured during three synchronised oestrous cycles. The ewes were restricted to maintenance feeding for the ®rst 12 days of each oestrous cycle and then increased to ad libitum for the 5 days prior to and including ovulation. Lotus contained 18 g total CT/kg dry matter in the feed offered. There were only trace amounts of total CT in pasture. In vitro organic matter digestibility 􏰀OMD) of the diet selected was higher for lotus 􏰀0.82 versus 0.74) than for pasture, whilst the two forages contained a similar nitrogen concentration.
Mean ovulation rates 􏰀ORs) at cycle 3 for CT-acting and PEG sheep grazing lotus and for sheep grazing pasture were, respectively, 1.79, 1.58 and 1.48, with corresponding lambing percentages being 1.69, 1.39 and 1.22. Fecundity 􏰀number of corpora lutea 􏰀CL) per ewe ovulating) at cycle 3 ovulation and lambs born per ewe lambing were greater for ewes grazing lotus than pasture 􏰀P ` 0X01), and for CT-acting than for PEG sheep grazing lotus 􏰀P ` 0X05). Increases in fecundity were due to a lower proportion of single ovulations and a greater proportion of multiple ovulations. CT increased reproductive ef®ciency by increasing fecundity and by reducing embryonic loss.
Rumen ammonia and blood plasma urea concentrations were lower for ewes grazing lotus than pasture 􏰀P ` 0X01), and were generally lower for CT-acting than for PEG sheep grazing lotus. The nutritional treatments had little effect on plasma ammonia concentration.
Organic matter intake 􏰀OMI) 􏰀P ` 0X05), clean wool production 􏰀P ` 0X01) and staple length 􏰀P ` 0X001) were signi®cantly higher for ewes grazing lotus than for pasture. Liveweight gain 􏰀LWG) was low, and lower for sheep grazing lotus than pasture. There was no difference in OMI and LWG due to CT in lotus, but wool length 􏰀P ` 0X01) and clean wool production 􏰀P 􏰄 0X07) were higher for CT-acting than for PEG supplemented ewes 􏰀CT not acting).
It was concluded that grazing lotus during mating increased the ef®ciency of reproduction and clean wool production, with a component due to the action of CT. Possible mechanisms for CT increasing reproductive ef®ciency are discussed."

An experiment was conducted to compare the production performance and meat quality of grazing lambs finished on red clover (Trifolium pratense), lucerne (Medicago sativa) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) swards. Replicate (n 1⁄4 2) swards of red clover, lucerne and perennial ryegrass were rotationally grazed by ten ram lambs and ten ewe lambs from weaning until selection for slaughter at UK fat class 3L. Lambs grazing the red clover sward had a significantly higher live- weight gain and required significantly fewer days to slaughter than lambs grazing the lucerne sward (305gd)1 vs.243gd)1;38dvs.50d),whichinturn had a higher liveweight gain and required fewer days to slaughter than lambs grazing the perennial ryegrass sward (184 g d)1; 66 d). Lambs grazing the red clover and lucerne swards had significantly higher herbage intakes than those grazing the perennial ryegrass sward (2Æ06, 1Æ72 and 1Æ16 kg DM d)1 respectively), but in vivo digestibility of herbage was similar. Lambs grazing the red clover and lucerne swards also had significantly higher serum urea concentrations than those grazing ryegrass (12Æ5, 11Æ1 and 6Æ2 mmol L)1 respectively). Killing-out percentage was significantly higher for lambs grazing the red clover sward than for lambs grazing the perennial ryegrass sward (48% vs. 46%). There were no significant effects of finishing system on meat flavour, but meat from lambs finished on the lucerne sward was oxidatively less stable than that from lambs finished on the perennial ryegrass sward. Grazing the forage legume swards significantly increased the proportion of linoleic and linolenic acid in muscle tissue, and therefore the proportion of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids (0Æ19, 0Æ16 and 0Æ12 for the red clover, lucerne and perennial ryegrass swards respect- ively). However, the n)6/n)3 ratio was significantly lower for the muscle of lambs grazing the perennial ryegrass sward compared with those grazing the forage legume swards (1Æ13, 1Æ08 and 0Æ98 for the red clover, lucerne and perennial ryegrass swards respectively).

"The productive performance of highly fecund ewes and their progeny on ryegrass-based swards is limited in late pregnancy and lactation. Alternative herbages, such as chicory, plantain and red and white clover, have the potential to improve performance levels. In the present study, 49 twin- and 42 triplet-bearing Romney composite ewes bred to either Suffolk or Romney rams were allocated to one of three nutritional treatments from Day 131 of pregnancy [19 twin ewes on a ryegrass–white clover sward mix (Rye/WC); 16 twin ewes on a plantain–ryegrass sward mix (Plant/Rye); 14 twin ewes on a chicory–plantain–red and white clover sward mix (Herb); 13 triplet ewes on Rye/WC; 16 triplet ewes on Plant/Rye; and 13 triplet ewes on Herb] and remained on these sward treatments with their lambs until 75 days after the midpoint of the lambing period (L75). Nutritional treatment had no effect (P > 0.05) on ewe liveweight, body condition score (BCS) or non-esterified fatty acid and b-hydroxybutyrate concentrations on Day 145 of pregnancy. At L75, ewes on the Herb treatment sward were heavier than ewes on Plant/Rye (70.75  1.31 v. 61.43  1.28 kg, respectively) and had a higher BCS than ewes on either Plant/Rye or Rye/WC (2.7  0.1, 2.2  0.1 and 2.3  0.1, respectively). Sire type and nutritional treatment had no affect (P > 0.05) on lamb birthweight or weight at L75.

Neither birth rank, sire type nor ewe treatment had any effect (P > 0.05) on maximum heat production on a per kg liveweight basis or total heat production.

However, no such relationship was observed in lambs born to Suffolk sires (79.8% v. 84.8%, respectively).

However, several factors, including the emergence of helminths resistant to pharmaceutical anthelmintics, are forcing farmers to seek alternative ap- proaches to parasite control. Studies in New Zealand have shown that some alternative forages may reduce parasitic infestation in sheep. In the current study, it was found that under UK environ- mental conditions lambs with naturally acquired helminth infections grazing chicory (Cichorium intybus) and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) had fewer helminth parasites than sheep graz- ing ryegrass/white clover (Lolium perenne/Trifolium repens). Twelve pure-bred Lleyn male lambs grazed replicated 0.5 ha plots of birdsfoot trefoil, chicory or ryegrass/white clover for 5 weeks. Liveweight and faecal egg counts (FECs) were determined weekly and eight lambs per forage were slaughtered at the end of the trial to determine total helminth intensities. Lambs grazing birdsfoot trefoil had a lower FEC on day 7 (P < 0.05) and fewer total adult helminths than those grazing the other forages on day 35 (P < 0.01). Lambs grazing chicory did not have significantly lower FEC than lambs grazing other forages but these lambs were found to have fewer total adult abomasal helminths than lambs grazing ryegrass/white clover (P < 0.001). As the performance of grazing lambs is inversely correlated with the intensity of helminth parasites, these alternative forages could be used to improve the liveweight gain of lambs produced in the UK. Overall, the results support the contention that alternative forages could have a positive role in the control of helminth parasites in sheep, subject to successful agronomic development and integration of these forages into whole farm systems."

Replicate plots (n=2) of red clover (Trifolium pratense), lucerne (Medicago sativa), lotus (Lotus corniculatus) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were established in May 1999 at the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER), Aberystwyth, and maintained at a similar vegetative growth stage. From the beginning of September 1999 each forage was grazed by 10 wether lambs and 10 ewe lambs. The lambs grazed the experimental plots from weaning until they reached fat-class 3L. There was a significant decline in crude protein (CP) concentration in lucerne (x2.6 g/kg DM/day, P<0.05) and lotus (x2.5 g/kg DM/day, P<0.001) over the grazing period, while the CP concentration in red clover and ryegrass remained comparatively constant. Growth rates were highest for lambs grazing lotus compared with lambs grazing the other forages, and growth rates were significantly higher for lambs grazing red clover than for lambs grazing rye- grass. Growth rates of lambs grazing lucerne were significantly lower than lambs grazing lotus but similar to that of lambs grazing red clover and ryegrass. Lambs grazing the legume forages required significantly fewer days to finish compared with lambs grazing ryegrass. Cold carcass weight and killing out percentage were significantly higher for lambs grazing red clover compared with that for lambs grazing the other forages. Lambs grazing red clover and lucerne had significantly higher voluntary intakes, estimated using n-alkanes, than lambs grazing ryegrass, with intakes for lambs grazing lotus not significantly different. There were no treatment effects on in vivo digestibility. Levels of total protein and b-hydroxybutyrate in blood were unaffected by dietary treatment, although lambs grazing the forage legumes had significantly higher blood glucose and urea concentrations compared with lambs grazing ryegrass. Lambs grazing lotus had the highest plasma albumin. The results indicate that by grazing finishing lambs on forage legumes it is possible to increase growth rates and reduce time to finish without compromising carcass quality."

Fifty-six certified organic twin-rearing ewes were either drenched with an anthelmintic or not, within 2 days after parturition and were grazed upon either grass/clover or chicory pastures. Around 12 weeks after parturition a subset of 12 lambs per treatment was slaughtered for worm number and parasite species determination. The faecal egg counts of lambs from undrenched ewes grazing on chicory were significantly lower than those of lambs from undrenched ewes grazing on grass. Lambs grazing on chicory had similar abomasal worm counts as those grazing on grass at 12 weeks of age; the predominant species was Teladorsagia circumcincta. There was no difference between the intestinal worm counts in lambs grazing on grass or chicory, with Trichostrongylus vitrinus being the predominant species. Liveweight gains over the 126-day experimental period were significantly higher in lambs from drenched than those from undrenched ewes. Lambs from undrenched ewes grazing on chicory had higher liveweight gains compared to those from undrenched ewes grazing on grass. Although chicory grazing did not affect ewe nematode egg excretion, it resulted in lower egg counts in lambs and improved their liveweight gains to the same level as those deriving from drenched ewes."

A mixture containing red clover (T. pratense) instead of chicory, and ryegrass (Lolium perenne), was also included. Over summer and autumn, pastures were either grazed frequently (every 3-4 weeks) or infrequently (4-6 weeks), and at other times of the year every 4 weeks. Chicory establishment was high (82% of viable seed sown), 22
with 46 plants/m , declining to 15/m by Year 4,
whereas red clover plant numbers declined from 22
101/m to 13/m . Dry matter (DM) yields of chicory and red clover increased from Year 1 to Year 3, then declined in Year 4. Over the 4 years, chicory contributed 34, 80, 85, and 57%, respectively, to green DM yield; red clover contributed 9, 24, 77, and 13%. Yields of sown grass were inversely related to chicory or red clover yields (P < 0.001, r= 0.82), particularly for chicory-based pasture mixtures. Chicory and red clover both displayed a strong pattern of seasonal growth in response to temperature. This distinct pattern of growth for chicory-based pastures was greatest for mixtures with tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and prairie grass (Bromus willdenowii), grasses that were low- yielding. In contrast, phalaris (Phalaris aquatica)- chicory pastures had high grass growth in all seasons, resulting in the highest total annual DM yields and a more even seasonal spread of production. Ryegrass-chicory pastures were intermediate and ryegrass/cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata)-chicory pastures were lower-yielding. Red clover/ryegrass pastures had a more even seasonal spread of production, through greater winter and lower summer yields, than the chicory- based pastures. Frequent grazing significantly decreased DM yields of chicory (-19%), red clover (-61%), and total green herbage (-11%) compared with infrequent grazing, whereas there was no effect of grazing frequency on plant numbers of chicory or red clover."

The work was carried out near Palmerston North, New Zealand in 1992 and 1993.
Experiment 1 used lambs which were either genetically 'conventional' or 'resistant' to gastrointestinal nematodes and which had a naturally acquired heavy parasite burden (faecal egg count (FEC) 1300-2500 eggs per gram faeces (epg)). They were either drenched to remove all the parasites or remained undrenched when allocated to pure swards of either sulla or lucerne for the 28- day experimental period. Liveweight gains of drenched lambs were higher with sulla (mean 302 g/day) than with lucerne (mean 245 g/day; P < 002) and rates of gain were not reduced (P = 0-10) by genetic resistance to nematodes. Undrenched lambs had mean faecal egg counts of 1090-2220 epg after 28 days, with higher counts in lambs grazing lucerne than in those grazing sulla (P < 0-05). Lambs grazing lucerne also had a much lower average daily gain (ADG) (mean 50 g/day) than those grazing sulla (mean 206 g/day; P < 00001). Resistant lambs had reduced (P = 007) ADG in the sulla treatment only.
In Expt 2, lambs with a relatively low worm burden (average FEC 250 epg) were either drenched
to remove all worms or dosed with 20 000 Trichostrongylus colubriformis infective larvae and grazed on pure sulla or lucerne swards for 42 days. Drenched lambs had a similar liveweight gain (mean 190 g/day) and wool growth when grazing either sulla or lucerne. Undrenched lambs grazing sulla had
a greater ADG (mean 129 g/day) than those grazing lucerne (mean - 3 9 g/day; P < 00001) and a higher rate of wool growth from mid-side patches (P < 0009) and larger wool fibre diameter (P < 005) than those grazing lucerne. Undrenched lambs grazing sulla had lower FECs (P < 0'05) on days 14, 21, 35 and 42 than those grazing lucerne and lower (P < 005) Trichostrongylus colubriformis worm burdens at slaughter. Undrenched lambs had less perineal faecal contamination when grazing sulla rather than lucerne. Parasite-induced anorexia was evident in the lambs grazing lucerne but not in those grazing sulla.
These findings demonstrate that the performance of lambs infected with nematode parasites can vary substantially when given feeds of a similar chemical composition. The superior performance of lambs grazing sulla was probably caused by condensed tannins, which decrease protein degradation in the rumen and can increase post-ruminal protein availability."

Sulla contained 40-50 g condensed tannins (CT)/kg DM, whilst the pasture contained small amounts of CT (2-6 g/kg DM). After chewing during eating, a lower proportion of total CT was readily extractable and greater proportions were protein-bound and fibre-bound. Nutritional effects attributable to CT were assessed by oral administration of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which binds and inactivates CT, to half the animals grazing each forage. Rates of body growth were consistently higher for lambs grazing sulla than those grazing pasture, with the CT concentration in sulla being neither stimulatory or inhibitory to body growth or voluntary feed intake (VFI). The action of CT reduced carcass fatness in sheep fed both diets, in the one experiment where this was measured. CT present in both sulla and pasture decreased rumen ammonia concentration and decreased molar proportions of iso-butyrate and iso and w-valerate.

Numbers of protozoa and molar proportions of w-butyrate in rumen fluid were increased by CT in sheep grazing sulla but not pasture.
It was concluded that the higher rates of body growth and VFI in lambs grazing sulla was most likely to be due to its very high ratio of readily fermentable: structural carbohydrate.

Half the ewes grazing each forage were given daily oral polyethylene glycol (PEG : molecular weight 3500) supplementation to inactivate the condensed tannins (CT) in lotus. A rotational grazing system with 200 mixed age ewes (54n2p0n88 kgewe; 50 ewestreatment) was used.
The effect of forage species and PEG supplementation upon voluntary feed intake (VFI), concentration of plasma metabolites, reproductive efficiency, wool production and wool charac- teristics was measured during two synchronized oestrous cycles. The ewes were restricted to maintenance feeding for the first 12 days of each oestrous cycle and then increased to ad libitum for the 6 days prior to and including ovulation. Lotus contained 17 g total CTkg dry matter (DM) in the diet selected. There were only trace amounts of total CT in pasture. In vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD) was higher for lotus (0n82 v. 0n74) than for pasture, whilst lotus contained less nitrogen (N; 37n8 v. 44n5 gkg OM).
Mean ovulation rates (OR) for CT-acting and PEG sheep grazing pasture and lotus were respectively 1n33 v. 1n35 and 1n78 v. 1n56, with corresponding lambing percentages being 1n36 v. 1n36 and 1n70 v. 1n42. Fecundity (number of corpora luteaewe ovulating) was greater for ewes grazing lotus than pasture (P 􏰊 0n01), and tended to be greater for CT-acting than for PEG sheep grazing lotus (P l 0n06). In unsupplemented sheep, ewes grazing lotus had increased plasma concentrations of branched chain amino acids (BCAA; 57%) and essential amino acids (EAA; 52%) compared to ewes grazing pasture.
In ewes grazing pasture, PEG administration had no effect on plasma concentrations of urea and free amino acids, VFI, reproductive efficiency and wool production. However, in sheep grazing lotus, plasma concentrations of urea were significantly lower and concentrations of most amino acids were significantly higher for CT-acting than for PEG supplemented ewes (CT not acting); there was no difference in VFI between these two groups. Compared to ewes grazing pasture, ewes grazing lotus had similar VFI but produced more wool with longer staples and thicker fibre diameter, with there being no effect of PEG supplementation.
It was concluded that feeding lotus increased the efficiency of both reproduction and wool production without an increase in VFI, and that a possible cause was the action of CT in increasing plasma EAA and especially BCAA concentration."

Measurements were made of pre- and post-grazing herbage mass, the composition of the feed on offer and diet selected, voluntary feed intake (VFI), liveweight gain (LWG), carcass growth, wool growth and the concentration of metabolites in rumen fluid. For both lotus and lucerne swards, the diet selected was mainly leaf. Lotus contained 34 g total CT/kg dry matter in the diet selected, whilst there were essentially no CT in lucerne. Compared to lambs grazing lucerne, lambs grazing lotus had slightly lower VFI, and higher LWG, carcass weight gain, carcass dressing-out percentage and wool growth. PEG supplementation had no effect on these measurements or upon the composition of rumen fluid in lambs grazing lucerne. However, in lambs grazing lotus, PEG supplementation reduced wool growth (109 v. 121 g/day), slightly reduced LWG (188 v. 203 g/day), increased rumen ammonia concentration, and increased the molar proportions of /.so-butyric, iso- valeric and n-valeric acids and protozoa numbers in rumen fluid. PEG supplementation did not affect carcass gain, carcass fatness or the molar proportion of rumen acetic, propionic or n-butyric acids in lambs grazing lotus. It was concluded that the principal effect of CT in growing lambs grazing lotus was to increase wool growth without affecting VFI, thereby increasing the efficiency of wool production, that the greater rate of carcass gain of lambs grazing lotus than those grazing lucerne was mainly caused by factors other than CT and that CT did not affect the rumen fermentation of carbohydrate to major volatile fatty acids."

Cullen	1965	A comparison of the yield and composition of various mixtures of lucerne and grass sown in alternate rows with lucerne sown as a pure stand	"Various lucerne (Medicago sativa L.)/grass associations were com- pared with lucerne sown alone over a three-year period on high-fertility soil at Invermay Research Station. Companion grasses induded cocks- foot (Dactylis glomerata L.). timothy (Phlellm pratellse L.), perennial ryegrass (Lo/illm perelllle L.), short-rotation ryegrass (Lotillm perenne
X L. milltijlorum). phalaris (Phalaris tllberosa L.), meadow fescue (Festllca pratellsis Huds.), tall fescue (Festllca arundinacea Schreb.),
and prairie grass (Bronllls catharticlls V ah!.).
All mixtures out-yielded lucerne sown alone in the first year, but differe:1ces in yield were small thereafter. The inclusion of a companion grass helped to control weeds except in the phalaris treatment.
Although all the grasses had some merit, cocksfoot and tall fescue were considered superior to the others. Mixtures of lucerne with cocks- foot and tall fescue were more productive in winter than lucerne alone, weed control was good, and the balance of lucerne and grass was satis- factory. In the first year the grass was the dominant component of both mixtures: in the second year ""yields were similar from lucerne and grass, while in the final year lucerne contributed the greater portion of the herbage.
It is considered that more use could be made of these mixtures where conditions are similar to those of Invermay Research Station."

2021RGHLsnow134	2021RGHLsnow134	N.A. Thomson	1977	Factors affecting animal production: intake and utilization by ewes grazing grass/clover and lucerne pastures 	"The total productivity from a ewe/lamb system on grass/clover and luccrne pastures stocked at 15 and 20 ewes/ha, respectively, over a 12-month period was compared. Intensive monitoring of yield, botanical, and chemical composition of total available and residual pasture enabled factors associated with production efficiency -
      i.e., intake and utilization - to be determined and factors critically affecting these identified.
  Lucerne pastures produced iess iiveweighr of iambihecrare at weaning (lucerne 552 and grass/clover 583 kg/ha) but more wool (lucerne 95 and grass/clover 70 kg greasy wool/ha) from an in- creased annual DM production of 7000 kg/ha above 13 040 kg DM/ ha produced from grass/clover.
The single grazing utilization of pasture during lactation (grass/ clover 53%, lucerne 63%) was relatively high compared with utiliza- tion recorded during maintenance (grass/clover 61%, lucerne 57%) considering the apparent intakes (grass/clover 2 x and lucerne 2.2~ maintenance) and lamb growth recorded. High utilization of pastures whilst meeting the high nutrient rcquircments of lacta- tion was attributed to the high digestibility and proportion of green matter of pasture during this period compared with low values during maintenance.
Apparent intake of ewes grazing grass/clover pasture was corre- lated with yield of green matter (r = 0.85) and percentage green (r = 0.57) in available pasture. On lucerne, apparent intake was
not correlated with green vield but vield of DOM (r = 0.61) and % DOM (r = 0.61) .- .
High selection by ewes for green matter resulted in the composi- tion of intakes being similar in percentage green matter on both pasture types irrespective of physiological state of the animal or composition of available pasture.
The composition of pasture and the percentages of DOM and of green matter were found to be critical factors all’ccting intake and utilization and the overall production eficiency of ewe/lamb pas- toral system."

The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of legume forages compared to ryegrass on interactions between production, nutritional status and nematodes in grazing lambs. Twenty-four male lambs per forage treatment, half of which were treated with anthelmintics on Day 0, grazed monocultures of lucerne (Medicago sativa), red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (Trifolium repens) and were compared with lambs grazing perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Individual faecal egg counts (FEC) and liveweight were determined every 7 days for 56 days, after which half the lambs were slaughtered to determine total nematode intensities (TNI). Results showed that lambs grazed on red or white clover, but not lucerne, had lower pooled mean FEC and improved liveweight performance compared to lambs grazing ryegrass. Lambs treated with anthelmintics had higher TNI compared to lambs not treated, due to a trend for more adult nematodes in lambs grazing lucerne and treated with anthelmintics than all other lambs, except those grazing red clover and also given anthelmintics. Lambs grazing white clover tended to have fewer adult nematodes than lambs grazing other forages. Examination of the nematode species showed a change in female T. circumcincta occurred in all lambs following anthelmintic treatment and that the forage species grazed by lambs affected individual parasite species. Lambs grazing white clover had fewer male and adult T. circumcincta compared to lambs grazing other forages, and lambs grazing lucerne had fewer adult T. circumcincta compared to lambs grazing ryegrass or red clover. Data on small intestine TNI showed that lambs grazing lucerne and given anthelmintics had more male adult nematodes than other lambs, except those grazing red clover and treated with anthelmintics. Results indicate that lucerne and red clover both increase the re-infection of grazing lambs with Trichostrongylus species compared to ryegrass following anthelmintic treatment. In conclusion, legume forages have the potential to contribute to the control of abomasal but not small intestine nematode parasites in finishing lamb systems."

A new allotment of feed was provided at seven-day intervals, and feed was available ad libitum. Total worm burdens in a pre-treatment slaughter group were ca. 22 000 of which ca. 5000 were in the abomasum. Within each forage type, 10 of the 25 lambs (NP) were given an anthelmintic drench at 14-day intervals and the remaining 15 lambs (P) were not drenched. Daily gains of the NP lambs were double that of P lambs which grazed either L. corniculatus, lucerne or pasture, but parasitism had a lesser effect on performance of lambs which grazed sulla and L. pedunculatus. Plantain was not palatable and all lambs performed poorly. Highest daily gains in P lambs were for those which grazed sulla (175 g/day) and L. pedunculatus (160 g/day) with total worm burdens of 13 100 and 23 000 for the respective treatment groups. The other forages resulted in lower daily LWG in P lambs, and performance was not related to either worm burdens or worm species. This experiment has shown that, when sulla is fed, there is a reduction in worm burdens and faecal egg count (FEC), but with Maku lotus which also contains CT, the good level of performance was achieved despite in high worm burdens and FEC. The mechanisms by which these forages enable high levels of productivity in the face of a parasitism appear to differ, but both could be incorporated into forage feeding systems to reduce dependence on anthelmintic drenches."

The 56 lambs (by Dorset Down rams out of Border Leicester X Corriedale ewes) of approximately 8 weeks of age were randomised to four treatment groups. Two of the groups were grazed on pure perennial ryegrass and two on pure lucerne for 7 weeks before slaughter. Seven of the lambs in each of the treatment groups received 336 )Lg diethylstilboestrol by subcutaneous injection weekly. Carcass composition was determined by chemical analyses.
The lambs grazed on lucerne grew at 0.37 kg/day, 76% faster than those on perennial ryegrass (0.21 kg/day). The hot carcasses of the lucerne-grazed group were 7.0 kg heavier than those of the perennial ryegrass group and differed in composition (+ 3.7% fat, -3.1% water, + 0.8% protein, no difference in ash). This difference in carcass com- position is explained by the increase in carcass weight.
Oestrogen treatment enhanced live-weight gain (+ 0.04 kg/day); did not affect hot carcass weight; reduced the fat content of the car- cass by 2%; and increased the water content by a similar figure.
These results are discussed in relation to previous work on pure pasture species and implantation of diethylstilboestrol, and brief re- ference is made to the relative rates of growth of the carcass com- ponents."

Crop growth was studied during the 8 weeks preceding each grazing.
Sainfoin had a high proportion of green leaf and a high weight per unit area of leaf, and the stem as well as the leaf was readily eaten. The yield and persistence of sainfoin were poor, the number of plants and the number of shoots per plant were low, the development of leaf area was slow, and nitrogen content and digestibility were rather low.
Red clover had a high proportion of green leaf, large leaves, high nitrogen content and fairly high digestibility, and the stem as well as the leaf was readily eaten. Yield was low except at the first two grazings of the first harvest year, and persistence was poor, there being a large number of plant deaths near the time of the second grazing.
Lucerne was higher yielding and more persistent than the other legumes, with a satisfactory number of plants, a relatively large number of shoots per plant, a high rate of emergence of leaves and a relatively large amount of branching. The lucerne had a rather high proportion of stem, and the stem was of rather low digestibility and not very attractive to the sheep.
The hybrid ryegrass yielded more herbage than the legumes, had a satisfactory and increasing number of tillers, increased in yield relatively early in spring and recovered well after defoliation. The proportion of green leaf was low by the end of each of the first two growth periods of each year, the leaves emerged at a rather slow rate in the later stages of a growth period, the crop had a relatively high proportion of cell wall and the stem in particular was relatively unattractive to the sheep."

Lotuspedunculatus(cv.GrasslandsMaku)grownonacidlow-fertilitysoilandcontaininghighconcentrations of condensed tannin ( 7 6 9 0 g/kg dry matter (DM)) was grazed by growing sheep for 3 1 4 2 d periods in three experiments. In Expt 2 an additional group of lambs grazed areas oversown with white clover (Trifolium repens) and red clover (Trifoliumpratense). Lambs were transferred from grazing ryegrass (Loliumperenne) - white clover straight on to lotus in all experiments (unconditioned sheep). In Expt 3 a second group was included which had grazed high-tannin lotus for a pre-experimental period of 8 weeks (conditioned sheep).
2. Effects of condensed tannin on body and wool growth were assessed by studying responses to daily oral administration of polyethylene glycol (PEG; molecular weight 3350, 75-100 g/d). PEG forms a complex with condensed tannin, which is assumed to be inert in its passage through the digestive system, and so effectivelyreduces the nutritional effects attributable to high condensed-tannin concentrations.
3. Live-weight gain (LWG) in the absence of PEG was low (27-125 g/d) for sheep grazing high-tannin lotus, and PEG administration increased LWG by 41-61 g/d and increased wool growth. In Expt 3, responses to PEG supplementation tended to be less with conditioned than with unconditioned sheep, indicating that conditioned sheep had partially adapted to the high-tannin diet.
4. PEG supplementation had no effect on either LWG or wool growth of sheep grazing areas oversown with mixed clovers, confirming its effects as specific to forages containing condensed tannins. These experiments therefore conclusivelyshow that high concentrations of condensed tannin induced by growing Lotuspedunculatus under low soil fertility conditions prevent maximum expression of LWG and wool growth in grazing sheep. These results contrast with high LWG (153-315 g/d) observed in growing sheep grazing the same lotus cultivar grown in high fertility soil and containing 20 g condensed tannin/kg DM, a level considered to be nutritionally beneficial."

Lambs which grazed lotus continuously had significantly higher live-weight gains than lambs which grazed lotus for 7 or less days each fortnight. Flystrike was positively correlated with dags although this was less obvious over time-period 1 when the incidence of flystrike was low. The incidence of flystrike differed significantly between treatment groups ((2 P<0.001), ranging from 36% of lambs struck in the all ryegrass/white clover groups to 7% in the all lotus groups.

The effect of nirogen and frequency of cutting"	"The yields of two varieties of lucerne sown alone and in associalion with each of three grasses were compared wilh similar red clover/grass mixtures over the period 1953-56 under two levels of nitrogenous and potassic fertilizers and two cutting treatments. The main object ofthe experiment was to gain a wider knowledge of the productivity and chemical composition of lucerne sown alone, and in mixtures, under relatively high rainfall conditions.
The highest production was obtained from Du Puits and its mixtures, which exceeded Grimm and S 123 red clover mixtures. The yields of the lucerne/grass mixtures were not significantly better than those of the pure sown lucerne. Under the most favourable conditions for lucerne, Du Puits elimi- nated practically all the sown grasses, viz.. S 23 ryegrass, S 51 timothy and S 215 meadow fescue.
The application of nitrogen encouraged the growth of the grasses, often at the expense of the legume, especially the slower growing Grimm and S 12.1. The effect on Du Puits was less marked, but in no case was there a stibstantial increase in actual legume yield. Increasing the level of potas- sium, although not immediately affecting the yield, proved beneficial to lucerne survival in the later years. The protein yield from the best lucerne plots was found to be double that from pure grass swards heavily fertilized with nitrogen.
Three cuts of lucerne in the first two harvest years had a disastrous effecl on the carry-over of lucerne from the second to the third year. Both varieties of lucerne and their mixtures behaved in a similar fashion, although S 123 red clover appeared to be indifferent to these conditions. It is suggested that the cause of this was the unfavourable weather experienced in 1954."

In that study four sward types were investigated: a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) only sward receiving 163 kg nitrogen per hectare per year (N/ha/yr) (PRG); a perennial ryegrass and white clover (Trifolium repens) sward receiving 90 kg N/ha/yr ( PRGWC); a six species sward (two grasses (perennial ryegrass and timothy (Phleum pratense)), two legumes (white and red clover (Trifolium pratense)) and two herbs (ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and chicory (Cichorium intybus)) receiving 90 kg N/ha/yr (6S); and a nine species sward containing cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata), greater birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus pedunculatus) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium) in addition to the six species listed above, receiving 90 kg N/ha/yr (9S). Each sward type was managed as a separate farmlet and stocked with 30 twin-rearing ewes at a stocking rate of 12.5 ewes/ha under rotational grazing management from turnout post-lambing until housing. Lamb live weight was recorded fortnightly and lambs were drafted for slaughter at 45 kg. Ewe live weight and body condition score (BCS) were recorded on five occasions annually. Lamb faecal egg count (FEC) was recorded fortnightly and lambs were treated with anthelmintics when mean lamb FEC per sward type was above 400 eggs per gram. Ewes grazing the 6S and 9S swards had heavier ( P < 0.01) live weights and BCS throughout the study than the ewes grazing the PRG sward. Lambs grazing the 6S sward were heavier than lambs grazing all other sward types of 14 weeks old ( P < 0.05). Lambs grazing the PRG sward required more days to reach slaughter weight than lambs grazing all other sward types ( P < 0.001). Lambs grazing the 6S and 9S swards required fewer anthelmintic treatments than lambs grazing the PRG or PRGWC swards.

Mandaluniz	2021	Regenerative rotational grazing management of dairy sheep increases springtime grass production and topsoil carbon storage	"Increased traditional dairy sheep production in the Basque Country of northern Spain could substantially affect pasture soils. This type of agricultural land performs vital functions and provides essential ecosystem services. Regenerative farming practices such as rotational grazing with prolonged resting periods are designed to improve farmland soil health, while profitably delivering high-quality farm products. The aim of this study was to determine the mid-term effect of rotational grazing on soil ecosystem services and evaluate their synergies and trade-offs. A 4.5-ha experimental pasture was divided into two sections: one subjected to regenerative rotational grazing and the other to conventional rotational grazing. A flock of 135 Latxa breed dairy ewes was evenly distributed over the two areas during six consecutive years. On the conventional rotational grazing section, the sheep were allowed to feed for 6–10 d followed by a 15-d rest period. On the regenerative rotational grazing section, the sheep were allowed to feed for 1–2 d followed by a 24-d rest period. Vegetation and soil were then sampled according to a grid design. Springtime grass production was estimated by cutting the vegetation, topsoil carbon storage was determined through elemental analysis of soil organic carbon, nutrient cycling was calculated by measuring the activity of six enzymes (β-glucosidase, β-glucosaminidase, sulfatase, acid phosphatase, L-alanine aminopeptidase, and L-leucine aminopeptidase), water flow regulation was calculated using a simplified water retention index, and biodiversity was determined via 16S rRNA metabarcoding of soil prokaryotes. Regenerative rotational grazing achieved 30% higher springtime grass production and 3.6% higher topsoil carbon storage than conventional rotational grazing. The other parameters did not differ significantly between the grazing regimes. Regenerative rotational grazing reduced relative data dispersion for all ecosystem services, possibly because it supported comparatively homogeneous pasture use by livestock and avoided the negative consequences of overgrazing and undergrazing. Thus, regenerative rotational grazing might effectively improve certain soil ecosystem services without causing trade-offs to others. © 2021 The Author(s)"	Ecological Indicators	125	10748	Spain	"NEIKER, Arkaute "	42.853	-2.625	Rotational grazing	"HDM, SOC"	Table 1	2014	2019	6	182	Complete randomised block	3	High

(Special Issue: The impact of grazing on land degradation: a common problem with many driving forces.)"	"Grazing management is a known influence of carbon accumulation in agricultural soil, but there is conflicting evidence on the extent. This study compared organic carbon and nitrogen stocks at the conclusion of a 5-year grazing trial on a fertilised native pasture in south-eastern Australia. The study included three grazing treatments: ungrazed, tactically grazed (set stocking with biannual rest periods) and cell grazed (intense stocking with frequent long rest periods). There was no influence of grazing treatment detected on pasture sward composition when averaged over seasons or on total nitrogen or bulk density. The cell grazing treatment had total carbon stock of 32.9 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> (SE=1.8) in the 0-0.30 m soil layer, which was a significant increase (p<0.05) relative to the ungrazed treatment at 25.6 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> but not statistically greater than the tactical treatment at 29.5 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup>. There was no difference detected in labile carbon stocks to 0.30 m, which indicates that differences in soil carbon due to grazing was accumulated over the 5-year trial rather than reflecting short-term seasonal impacts. We propose that a combination of factors contributed to a greater stock of soil carbon under grazed pastures including differences in plant shoot/root allocation, root growth and root turnover with defoliation under grazing as well as lower plant productivity where grazing is excluded because of shading and nutrient tie-up. This study demonstrates removing grazing pressure may lead to lower soil carbon stocks in native pastures over time and provides evidence of the potential for grazing management to increase soil carbon in the short-term."

The aim was to quantify C allocation to roots in contrasting pastoral ecosystems. Pastures on long-term research sites in Canterbury, New Zealand were pulse-labelled using (CO2)-C-13 within portable gas-tight enclosures. Sites included Winchmore (with or without superphosphate fertiliser, and with or without irrigation) and Tara Hills (low, medium or high grazing intensity with continuous or alternating grazing). Separate micro-plots were labelled in late spring, summer and autumn at Winchmore and in spring at Tara Hills. Herbage label C-13 recoveries were greatest one hour after pulse labelling and declined by 21 days, whereas in roots they were initially lower but generally continued to increase until 21 days. The greatest recoveries of C-13 in roots, one hour and 21 days after labelling, were in summer and autumn respectively. The proportion of label C-13 allocated to roots by 21 days was 0.50 in the absence of superphosphate and 0.41 in the superphosphate treatment, and was 0.39, 0.43 and 0.51 respectively in spring, summer and autumn. Irrigation had no significant effect on root allocation. The low stocking rate at Tara Hills, which had the greatest herbage biomass, also had greater total C-13, tussock herbage C-13 and root C-13 recoveries than the higher stocking rate treatments. Inter-tussock root recovery and allocation of C-13 to roots increased with increasing stocking rate, whereas tussock root allocation was greatest in the high and least in the medium stocking rate treatment. By 21 days there was a greater inter-tussock and tussock root recovery and lower inter-tussock herbage recovery in the continuous than in the alternating grazing management treatment. The root allocation was generally greater in the continuous than in alternating grazed treatments, except for tussocks one hour after labelling where the reverse was the case. In conclusion the C-13 pulse labelling showed pasture plants allocate more C to roots with low soil fertility, high grazing intensity, continuous grazing, and in autumn."

Clark"	2003	Effects of grazing method and fertiliser inputs on the productivity and sustainability of phalaris-based pastures in Western Victoria 	"The effects of combinations of different fertiliser rates and grazing methods applied to phalaris-based pastures on an acid, saline, yellow sodosol on the Dundas Tablelands of western Victoria (mean annual rainfall 623 mm) were measured from 1997 to 2000. The objective was to help identify management systems that improve phalaris growth and persistence, water use, and animal production, and thereby the productivity and sustainability of grazing systems. Pastures were either set stocked with low [mean 6.4 kg phosphorus (P)/ha.year] or high (mean 25 kg P/ha.year) fertiliser rates, or rotationally grazed with high fertiliser (mean 25 kg P/ha.year). Rotational grazing was implemented as either a simple ‘4-paddock’ system (fixed rotation length), or a more intensive system where rotation length varied with pasture growth rate. Unreplicated paddocks of volunteer pasture (dominated by onion grass and annual grass weeds) receiving an average of 8 kg P/ha.year were also monitored. All treatments were stocked with spring-lambing Merino ewes. Stocking rate was an emergent property of each treatment, and was driven by pasture quality and availability.
Total pasture herbage accumulation ranged from 7150 to 9750 kg DM/ha.year and was significantly lower on the set-stocked, low-fertility treatment than on all other treatments. A significant treatment.day effect in the spline analysis of herbage mass was explained by a trend toward higher pasture mass in the rotationally grazed treatments than set-stocked treatments from the break of season until mid-spring. Rotational grazing led to significantly higher phalaris herbage accumulation than set stocking (mean 3680 v. 2120 kg DM/ha.year), but significantly lower subterranean clover herbage accumulation (1440 v. 2490 kg DM/ha.year). Despite the stronger growth of deep-rooted phalaris in the rotationally grazed treatments, maximum soil water deficits at the end of summer differed only slightly between treatments, with the difference between driest and wettest treatments amounting to only 14 mm. Summer growth of phalaris was apparently insufficient to generate significant differences in soil water extraction at depth, even when phalaris content was increased by rotational grazing, and re-wetting of the soil profile occurred at a similar rate for all treatments. Rotationally grazed treatments supported higher stocking rates than set-stocked treatments at high fertiliser rates (mean 14.9 v. 13.7 ewes/ha), but apparent losses in pasture feeding value due to lower legume content under rotational grazing meant that there were few significant differences between treatments in lamb production per hectare.
The experiment showed that grazing method can have a substantial and rapid effect on pasture botanical composition. There are clear opportunities for producers to use temporal and spatial combinations of set stocking and rotational grazing to manipulate herbage mass and pasture composition within broad target ranges for achieving both animal production (e.g. high per-head animal performance) and sustainability (e.g. persistence of perennial grasses) objectives. Rigid application of either set stocking or rotational grazing imposes limitations on both pasture and animal production, and neither grazing method will optimise system performance under all conditions. The experiment also demonstrated that management and land-use changes that have much greater potential to increase water use than those examined here will be needed to ensure the sustainability of pasture systems in the high rainfall zone of western Victoria."

Liveweight gain for alternating and rotational grazing was similar at all stocking rates, showing an advantage in animal performance over that from continuous stocking can be achieved with a minimal amount of subdivision fencing. The advantage to alternating and rotational grazing over continuous stocking was most obvious during late spring/early summer, suggesting that in practical terms runholders need to consider such management for ewes in late lactation with lambs still at foot. Wool growth/ha increased linearly with increased stocking rate, with advantage to alternating and rotational grazing evident at high stocking rates. In contrast to the lowland experience with Romneys, the rate of Merino wool growth declined as the grazing season progressed. Fibre diameter was 1.5 μm less at the high than at the low stocking rate. Practical application is discussed, with emphasis on achieving a realistic balance between objectives to maximise wool production and those to sustain pasture production and maintain desired

The comparison of grazing systems was made at two levels of milk yield (initially 20Æ3 and 32Æ5 kg d)1), and interactions with sward height and concentrate level were also examined. The study used 48 multipa- rous Holstein Friesian cows over a period of 62 d. Mean milk yield, its persistency and composition, live weight, body condition score and liveweight gain were not significantly affected by grazing system at either level of milk yield. There were no significant interactions between grazing system and sward height or concen- trate level for any milk production measurement. Mean estimated herbage and total dry matter (DM) intake (P < 0Æ01), grazing time (P < 0Æ05) and ruminating time (P < 0Æ01) were significantly greater on the continuous grazing system. The cows in the higher milk yield group and those grazed at the higher sward height had a significantly (P < 0Æ05) higher estimated daily herbage DM intake and rate of herbage intake on the contin- uous grazing system than those on the rotational grazing system. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that rotational grazing systems support higher levels of milk production than continuous grazing for cows of high milk yield. The shorter grazing time on the rotational grazing system indicated that cows may anticipate the timing of the daily movement of the electric fence, and this reduces their time spent grazing residual herbage."

Comparison of three systems of grazing 	"Three systems of grazing management (continuous grazing, ten-paddock rotational grazing and daily strip grazing) were compared using beef cattle at 1.5 cattle beasts per acre. The experiment started in early April with twelve cattle on each treatment. These were replaced in early August by twelve lighter cattle which remained on the experiment until late October for rotational and continuous grazing treatments, and until early November for the strip grazing treatment.
Surplus herbage was cut from twenty percent of the rotational and forty percent of the strip grazing area. No attempt was made to cut surplus herbage from the continuous grazing area because of the difficulty of ascertaining when surplus material was available. Yield of surplus herbage was
three times greater from the strip grazing area than from the rotational area. The system of grazing had no significant effect on total liveweight production per animal or per acre for the whole grazing season. Following cutting for conservation liveweight gain of strip grazing cattle was significantly
lower than that of either the continuous or the rotationally grazed cattle. From August until the end of the grazing season the performance of the strip grazing cattle was significantly better than that of the other treatments. No significant difference was detected between the performance of the continuous and rotationally grazed cattle during this period."

The objects of the experiment described were to ascertain the effect of increasing the stocking inten sity, and also the effects of two systems of grazing management on the performance of beef animals and on liveweight production per acre. Three stocking rates, 1.0, 1.75 and 2.5 cattle per acre on both rotational (10 paddock) and continuous grazing systems were compared for three grazing seasons.
The major results may be summarised as follows:
System of grazing had no significant effect on animal performance at the low and medium stocking rates. At the high stocking rate there was a significant increase in animal performance in favour of the rotational system in 1960 and 1961.
Increasing the stocking rate from low to medium caused a depression in animal performance which
was significant only under the continuous grazing system in 1960 and 1961. Increasing stocking rate from low to high caused highly significant decreases for all three seasons under both grazing systems. Increasing stocking rate from low to medium caused increases in liveweight gain per acre, varying from 23 to 74 percent under both grazing systems for the three years. By increasing stocking rate from medium to high, under the rotational grazing system, there was an increase of 38 percent in liveweight gain per acre for the 1960 grazing season when young light animals were used. In 1961 and 1962, when heavier older animals were used, there was no increase in the liveweight gain per acre.
Under the continuous system, increasing stocking rate from medium to high, increased liveweight production per acre in 1960, but depressed it in 1961 and 1962.
Stocking rate was a more important factor in increasing production per acre than system of grazing. Surplus herbage was cut from five treatments in 1960 and two treatments in 1961."

Eight spring- calved Ayrshire cows were used on each treatment at a stocking rate of 5 cows/ha (2 cows/ac). The mean daily milk yields per cow were 17-7 and 17-0 kg (39-0 and 37-5 Ib) on the Wye College and the paddock systems, respectively, in 1972; and 17-9, 17-7 and 16 4 kg (394, 38-9 and 36-2 Ib) on the Wye College, strip, and set-stocking systems in 1973. The average annual output of milk varied from 11,500 kg/ha (1030 gal/ac) on the set- stocking system to 12,500 kg/ha (1120 gal/ac) on the Wye College system, but none of the differences was significant. The most rapid decline in daily milk yield occurred on the set-stocking system in August and September as the amount of available herbage declined. This system requires further investigation.

A sward of S23 perennial ryegrass was used, and an average of 342 kg N/ha (305 lb N/ ac) was applied per annum. The paddock system had 28 separate paddocks; one paddock was grazed each day in rotation and occasionally topped in mid-season. The Wye College system had 4 plots of equal size and the cows were offered 1/7 of one plot each day; no back fence was used and surplus herbage was neither cut nor topped. The stocking rate on hoth systems was 1 cow per 0-20 ha (0-49 ac) in 1970 and per 016 ha (0 40 ac) in 1971. The mean daily milk yields per cow on the paddock and the Wye College systems were 162 and 15 3 kg (35 7 and 3 3 7 lb), respectively, in 1970; and 18.1 and 18.4 kg (39.9 and 40 6 lb) in 1971. The average annual output of milk was 13,500 and 13,150 kg/ha (1200 and 1170 gal/ac) on the paddock and Wye College systems, respectively. The fat and solids-not-fat (S.N.F.) contents of the milk were not significantly affected by the grazing system. It is concluded that the Wye College system was as effective as the paddock system in producing a high output of mUk per ha, but at a lower cost and with far fewer management decisions.

The intermit- tent systems were designed (a) to allow periodic increase in leaf area and hence growth rate, (b) to ensure that thc accumulated herbage was eaten before it senesced. and (c) lo retain high tiller density by alternating periods of herbage ac- cumulation with periods of continuous stocking.
Two treatments (no animals or animal numbers reduced to half those on the 35 cm steady-state treatment) were used during the 17-
18-d periods of herbage accumulation. Grazing down was completed in 3-^ d, after which two treatments (14 d or 28 d) were used for the intervening periods of continuous stocking when sward height was maintained at 3-5 cm.
Herbage production was estimated using the tissue turnover technique, with tiller population densities and rates of growth, senescence and net production per tiller measured at frequent inler- vals.
Intermittent grazing treatments where animals were removed during herbage accumulation resulted in changes in tiller size and number, and in growth rates, but not senescence rates, per tiller such that short-term deviations in the net rate of herbage production occurred compared with the continuously stocked control. The periods of advantage during phases of herbage accumu- lation were counterbalanced by those of disad- vantage during the subsequent steady-state phases. Where animal numbers were reduced during herbage accumulation, sward conditions differed little from those of the continuously stocked control, implying that intake per indi- vidual animal was increased.
It was concluded that intermittent grazing systems offered no advantage over simpler conti- nuous stocking systems, provided that a flexible approach to conservation was incorporated to allow control of sward conditions on the grazed area."

Herbage accumulation	"A grazing trial was conducted on 99 ha of moist, low-fertility hill country near Woodville, New Zealand, during 1975-1981. Treatments were: low fertiliser (125 kg/ha/a superphosphate (9070 P, 10% S» and high fertiliser (average 630 kg/ha/a super- phosphate, plus lime) application rates; and 3 grazing managements - rotational grazing by sheep and by cattle, and set stocking by sheep. Some replication was included in the design, 10 self-contained farmlets being used. Over a 6-year period stocking rate was increased from 6.5 to 12.0 and from 8.8 to 16.1 s.u.zha on low and high fertiliser farmlets respectively. Over this period, and also in the 3 previous years, herbage accumulation was measured, using grazing exclosures and a trim technique. November-April rainfall had a large effect on herbage accumulation rate (HAR) causing year-to-year variation of 23% about mean annual herbage accumulation. The high fertiliser treatment grew 9% more herbage than low fertiliser in the first year after differential application, and 21-50% more in the last 5 years. The main effect of the grazing management treatments was that annual
herbage accumulation in the rotationally grazed cattle pastures was depressed by 12% compared with the sheep-grazed pastures, presumed to be a result of severe treading damage. Differences in HAR between rotationally grazed and set-stocked sheep pastures were not detected. The trim technique used probably overestimated HAR of set-stocked pastures during the reproductive phase of grass growth. Measurements of herbage mass suggested that rotationally grazed sheep pastures grew about 20% more herbage over spring- early summer than set-stocked sheep pastures, or about 12% more on an annual basis. Slope of measurement site, on a within-hillside microtopo- graphic basis, had a strong negative relationship with HAR. For the linear part (15-27 0 slope) of the cubic function used, annual herbage accumulation decreased about 370 kg DM/ha/a per degree slope increase. Aspect influences on HAR were less marked than those of slope. NW and E aspect classes showed similar annual accumulation and pattern of seasonal accumulation. SW aspects had higher HARs than NW aspects for 2-4 months in January-April, and lower (20-40%) HARs for most of the remainder of the year. Seasonal spread of annual herbage accumulation was also influenced by grazing management, but was not influenced by fertiliser treatment or slope."

Grasslands Puna) were studied at Palmerston North, New Zealand (latitude 40°23'S) from November 1994 to November 1995. Three experiments were con- ducted on the same chicory stand, sown on 12 May 1994. The main grazing experiment had two grazing intensities, hard–lax grazing (50- to 100-mm stem stubble to mid-January, and thereafter 100- to 150- mm stem stubble) and lax grazing (100- to 150-mm stem stubble), and three grazing frequencies (1-, 2- or 4-week intervals). A subsidiary plant survival experiment compared the survival of 120 marked plants in ungrazed and grazed treatments. A late autumn grazing experiment examined the effects on plant persistence in the following spring. The great- est herbage mass (leaf 􏰉 stem) resulted from the 4- week grazing frequency [9640 ± 874 kg dry matter (DM) ha􏰊1], in which stem mass was reasonably low (1270 ± 410 kg DM ha􏰊1), but was significantly higher in the 4-week grazing frequency than 1- and 2-week grazing frequencies (P<0·01). Grazing intensity had no significant effect except on the average stem mass of individual plants when the hard-lax intensity gave a lower stem mass (P<0·01). There were no interactions between grazing frequency and intensity in herbage mass. Plant density declined by 35% over the growing season with the decline unaffected by grazing inten- sity or frequency during the season. Grazing in late autumn resulted in approximately 27% less plants in the following spring. It was concluded that grazing management through the growing season cannot be used to improve persistence without compromising leaf growth rate, but that avoidance of grazing in late autumn will improve the persistence of chicory."

A challenge for grazing management is to prevent pasture decline associated with the replacement of productive species by undesirable weedy species. The competitive ability, persistence and productivity of chicory were investigated under a gradient of grazing management practices ranging from continuous to short grazing–long rest treatments by merino wethers. Chicory density and percentage composition declined after the first year of continuous grazing. The density of chicory in all rotationally grazed treatments initially increased and then declined significantly after the third year, except in the short grazing–long rest treatment. The percentage composition of chicory in the pasture was influenced mainly by the frequency of grazing and to a lesser extent by stand age and was inversely related to the combined percentage composition of annual grasses and broadleaf species. The percentage composition of legumes was dependent more on seasonal conditions than on treatment. The interactions between chicory, grasses and broadleaf weeds are most probably driven by their competition for nitrogen."

Culvenor	2000	Comparison of four phalaris cultivars under grazing: drought survival and subsequent performance under rotational grazing versus set stocking	"Four cultivars of phalaris were evaluated for their ability to survive a severe drought in 1994 in an existing grazing experiment at 2 sites near Canberra. The effect of rotational grazing and set stocking on persistence of phalaris measured as basal cover, pasture composition in spring and animal production from the pastures was assessed over the next 4 years. Basal cover of all cultivars declined sharply in 1994, but had recovered by August 1995 at a site with a relatively deep soil profile. Recovery was slower at a site with a shallower soil profile. Sirosa declined more in basal cover than Holdfast and Australian at the latter site. All of the cultivars survived the drought well but Sirosa may be more sensitive to overgrazing in drought. Compared with set stocking, rotationally grazed pastures had a higher (P<0.001) proportion of phalaris for all cultivars 2 years after management treatments began, and a higher (P<0.005) basal cover for 2 winter-active cultivars after 3 years. Overall, a divergent effect of grazing management on basal cover (management × year interaction) could only be demonstrated at P = 0.08 because of a large effect of site variation for another winter-active cultivar, Sirosa. Phalaris basal cover did not decline with set stocking and it was concluded that rotational grazing was beneficial, but not crucial, for the persistence of winter-active phalaris cultivars in this environment. Site factors and their manipulation by management were also important for the persistence of phalaris. A review of the persistence of phalaris over the entire 9 years of the grazing experiment concluded that all cultivars displayed good persistence under conditions of reasonable soil fertility. The importance of good establishment for a high presence of phalaris in later years was emphasised."
