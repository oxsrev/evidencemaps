Although significant, the magnitude of the variable is rather small: all things being equal, female-headed households have 0.9 percentage points lower forest reliance compared to male-headed households. We note, however, that the negative effect is higher for forest income than for environmental in- come (and the coefficient is not significant for environmental reliance), suggesting that non-forest environmental income is relatively more accessible and/or attractive to female-headed households, as compared to forest income."

Though forest income in absolute value was high for male headed households, its relative importance to total household income was much higher for female headed households (58.2%) than male headed Households (29%). The gender dimension of forest income was also apparent within the household. The forest income generated by female members (Birr 2341 or 77% of the total household forest income) varied significantly from the amount generated by male members. The income generated by female members was almost four times greater than the amount generated by male members, which was Birr 566 or 23% of the total household forest income. Female members were involved mainly in firewood collection and to a certain extent in cutting and carrying grass for livestock feed. About 81.5% of firewood collection task was accomplished by female members of the household only, whereas males only and both male and female members undertook respectively, 2.5% and 16% of the firewood collection tasks conducted by a household. About 96.2% and 3.8% of the income from firewood and 5.3% and 94.7% of income from grass were generated by female and male household members, respectively. The contribution of male members were more pronounced for incomes from wood for construction and farm implements, forest seeds, medicinal plants and honey"

However, a substantial number of women also collected xate: 113 in 1998 and 159 in 1999. The ‘account book’ indicated that every time the xate merchant appeared in the community (about 45 times yearly), some women sold xate.Xate
collection, which could be done relatively close to home and whenever the women had spare time, represented a unique opportunity for them to earn an income. Moreover, most women themselves take the leaves they collect to market, receive payment, and control how the money is used. The extra income generated from xate collection by the women was used on clothes, kitchen supplies, and medicines for the children"

In Liben, the average total dry forest income (cash and subsistence) was Birr 2000 ± 273.81 for female headed households, and 3676 ± 1939.34 for male headed households and the variation was statistically significant (P b 0.05). Similarly, in Afdher Zone, the average total dry forest income for female headed households was less (Birr 2451 ± 1487) than those of male headed households (Birr 3496 ± 1874), although the difference was not statistically significant. This was contrary to the findings of Asfaw et al. (2013) where forest income of female headed households was much higher. But these communities lived close to markets and did not need means of transport to transport forest products. The purpose of dry forest product collection for cash was more among female headed households than male headed households. About 31% and 32% of the total income of female headed households in Liben and Afdher, respectively, came from dry forests, whereas the share of dry forest income was 34.4% and 35.6% for the two zones, respectively. Female headed households emphasized that for them dry forest income was the fastest, most accessible and relatively stable income source. For them livestock production was becoming very challenging, as it required frequent and distant migrations in search of fodder and water. They generally see crop production as labor, knowledge and cash-intensive, and often men's job, resulting in farming being less attractive to them. The key informants revealed that, despite their lack of involvement in dry forest management discourses, women's participation in forest product collection and marketing is growing."
