    "Name": "Report on Animal Welfare of Dairy Cows in Indoor Loose Range Housing: A Systematic Review",
    "Description": "Zero-grazing systems, where dairy cows are kept indoors permanently, are common in North America and becoming increasingly common in some parts of  Europe. Legislation in Sweden requires dairy cows to be grazed during summer months for a minimum number of days. This mandatory grazing period was introduced to protect the health and welfare of dairy cows and to allow them to express natural behaviours. There are strongly-held views both in favour of retaining the mandate for grazing but also for allowing farmers to choose zero-grazing systems. In addition to health, welfare and behaviour considerations, reasons for and against any change in legislation include social considerations of the agricultural landscape. There is a large volume of global research on the health and welfare implications of raising dairy cows in different systems, but relatively few that directly compare year-round loose-housing systems with systems that allow grazing or outdoor access. In order to contribute to evidence-informed policy, a systematic evidence evaluation was undertaken to determine what the objective scientific evidence base is for this question, and to assess whether the data in the evidence base as a whole are robust enough to determine any association between housing systems and health, welfare and natural behaviour in dairy cows. This interactive evidence map shows the results of a systematic evidence evaluation of research that compared the health, welfare and behaviour of dairy cows kept year-round in loose-housing with those given access to grazing and/or to zero-grazing outdoor exposure in temperate countries. The evidence base comprises studies from 53 articles from 24 countries and documents 120 different health, welfare and behaviour measures. The interactive map uses standard systematic review terminology: Population=dairy cows in temperate countries; Intervention=year-round loose-housing; Comparator=Other housing systems, with or without grazing; Outcomes= health, welfare and behaviour measures. The studies are clustered on the map geographically; the size of the clusters indicates the number of studies in the region. Users can zoom in on the map to the point where individual circles indicate individual studies. Clicking the circle brings up a summary sheet of the associated studies. Users can also filter the map to show studies on one or a combination of attributes (e.g. type of housing, breed of dairy cows, etc.), and by dimension slices to show numerical filters (e.g. year, number of farms, etc.).",
